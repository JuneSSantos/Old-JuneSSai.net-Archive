<p>Welcome to my site, the site where I'll post all sorts of different shit</p>
<p>Either it's posts about me rambling about some dumb bullshit you might not be interested into</p>
<p>Or me talking about things I just like or don't, if it's in my mind, it's very likely in here too.</p>
<br>
<p>My site is being updated semi-frequently, with more pages and features being added</p>
<p>whenever I get the idea, time and patience to do so, so who knows what's waiting for you tomorrow?</p>
<p>Either way, I hope you enjoy your stay! make sure to leave a message on the guestbook too!</p>
<br>
<p>Also, make sure to check the daily message and music recommendation on the bottom of this page aswell!</p>

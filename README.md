This is my website
I've learned the basics of HTML and CSS in about two days, with most of the time being used on experimentation to see what sticked, and what didn't, with the rest of the time being used to actually build the site
This website has the purpose of trying to bring the old attitude of the 2000s internet, hence why the site has this "retro" look to it, with it being mostly a personal site for me to talk and post the thing I like, with me trying my best to make it as unique and memorable as I possible can, and absolutely avoid everything the internet is doing nowadays to make their sites and the experience you have in the as bland as you possibly can
The site is still being heavily updated, but it might take a while for me to come up with new ideas for new features or even sections.

<h1>June's Comment</h1>
<p>Well, here we are again, with another update, and a big one aswell!</p>
<br>
<p>Recently, I've been getting into art again, an I've been drawing lots, mostly with friends on Aggie.io</p>
<p>And I wanted to post all these sketches and doodles somewhere in the site, but I was having trouble</p>
<p>deciding if I should post these on the "Finished Artwork" section, or at the "Fanart" section since</p>
<p>a lot of these canvas are mostly my other friends drawing since they draw faster and more than I do</p>
<p>So I was stuck on where to post all of this. And yes, I have Newgrounds, but I also want to give my</p>
<p>own website more content aswell, so ultimately, I decided to create a new section specifically for</p>
<p>the stuff I do with my friends</p>
<br>
<p>So welcome... to the Collabs Section!</p>
<p>The section were me and my friends (and sometimes friends of friends) do stuff together!</p>
<p>And what better way to debut this new part of the site than with a Beatum guest appearance?</p>
<br>
<p>This canvas is quite old too, like, a few months old, and I ended up posting it on Newgrounds</p>
<p>a while ago, but I still quite fond of this one, so I'm posting it in here aswell</p>
<br>
<p>This was mostly me fucking around with Dragon Ball Z, and Big Whiskey's family</p>
<p>Beatum did some silly (and concerningly detailed) creatures too, alongside a bunch of DBZ stuff</p>
<br>
<p>It was kinda fun, although my attempt to draw SSJ4 Gogeta on the upper left corner still makes me</p>
<p>cringe a little every time I see it.</p>
<br>
<p>But that's all for now, at least for this page</p>
<p>Expect more to come soon, so keep an eye on it for more funnies, I guess...?</p>

<h1>June's Comment</h1>
<p>Holy shit, I can't believe there's more stuff being posted!</p>
<p>And this time I even ended up doing a little concept comic for my characters aswell!</p>
<br>
<p>The characters in the comic are the Elemental Twins, from my unreleased/unfinished webcomic</p>
<p>called Elemental Nexus (which at one point was also called The Elemental Twins), which I've been</p>
<p>concepting and working around it for about 5 years now, and this little comic I've made in here shows</p>
<p>one of the planned scenes, where Summer (which at this point is this an antagonist) gets stuck in</p>
<p>a weird cave forest with Spring (I'll find better nicknames for them later, trust me) and is pretty much</p>
<p>forced to cooperate with her in order to get out of the caves alive, since she's the only one that knows</p>
<p>about the inner works of the cave</p>
<br>
<p>And Beatum ended up drawing a lot of stuff too, like his little characters, and mine and Ramen's character</p>
<p>I specially like the little pearl he did in there</p>
<br>
<p>But that's all for now, but don't you worry, there's more to come very soon!</p>
<p>See y'all in the next post!</p>

<h1>Author's Comment</h1>
<p>Welp, that's it</p>
<br>
<p>The Family Guy/Frickin' Sweet collab is officially dead.</p>
<p>After so many delays and issues behind the scenes, the collab organizer decided to throw the towel</p>
<p>and can the entire thing, so I'm officially allowed to upload my entry on Newgrounds since the</p>
<p>collab isn't going to be a thing anymore</p>
<br>
<p>I made this as a cover for the submission, it's pretty simple, but I think it's enough</p>
<p>If you want to see my submission, <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/841327" class="hyperlink">click here.</a></p>
<br>
<p>But that's about it for now</p>
<p>I'll eventually bring more sections and more features to the site, one of the planned features</p>
<p>being a dailies section, downloads section, so you can download things like maps and WADs that I</p>
<p>made from various games, and maybe even guest contributions pretty soon, but I still need more time</p>
<p>to flesh everything out, but it will come out eventually!</p>
<br>
<p>Anyways, I hope you're having a nice day</p>
<p>I'll see you around.</p>

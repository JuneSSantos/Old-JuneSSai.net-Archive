<h1>Author's Comment</h1>
<p>"Like my balls! (Tig Ol' Bitties!) Real Big! (Tig Ol' Bitties!) Oh my god!" -Humbert</p>
<br>
<p>Holy shit, it's been a while hasn't it?</p>
<p>I've been a little bit stuck when it comes to creations. I'm still struggling to come up with</p>
<p>new and interesting things, and nothing much has happened recently, although I did buy a cool</p>
<p>new jacket, a jacket that I'll probably redesign Big Whiskey with since he does wear the clothes</p>
<p>I use on a daily basis (like how his iconic jacket is a jacket I actually own and use in real life)</p>
<br>
<p>But enough bullshit, you're not here to hear about me, you're here to hear about the art! Probably!</p>
<br>
<p>This piece is actually a tribute to Your Favorite Martian as a whole, and if you're a fan of YFM</p>
<p>like me and you have an attentive eye, you'll definitely get a reference or two in this, if not</p>
<p>all of them.</p>
<br>
<p>YFM is a thing I've been listening through a good part of my life ever since it initially came out</p>
<p>pretty much, and the musics, even though they're silly and cheesy, and some of them questionable</p>
<p>actually inspired me a lot, and stuck with me even up to nowadays, I remember just being really</p>
<p>excited for new clips and seeing how many references I could get in a video of theirs</p>
<p>I had most of the YFM songs saved on my PS3, and I'd listen to it while playing LBP2 and 3 pretty</p>
<p>much at all times, even my friends and I were bopping to Tig Ol' Bitties when we were screwing around</p>
<p>in the LBP moon, and I even got my dad into YFM, we'd sing along to the songs and it was incredibly fun</p>
<p>Ironically, Ray William Johnson was responsible for some of my happiest memories in my life</p>
<p>That's either the funniest or the saddest statement of the fucking decade.</p>
<br>
<p>When I heard the project was being cancelled, I actually got really sad over it</p>
<p>I remember watching Boom Headshot back in the day, and it definitely had a "last hurrah" feel to it</p>
<p>with it just being a remix of all of their previous songs, with the clip being mostly</p>
<p>all of the characters getting killed in a DooM-esque imaginary game, and it definitely hit me hard</p>
<p>when I first heard it back then, and even though they were supposed to release another album, they</p>
<p>never did, they were gone, and so was a whole era of online content</p>
<p>either you like it or not, YFM was incredibly important to the internet, somehow</p>
<br>
<p>But now they're back, and I couldn't be happier about it.</p>
<br>
<p>Even though I'm still pretty mixed over the new designs, I'm really excited for YFM's return</p>
<p>and I really want to see it succeeding, I hope they keep the same style of music they had back in</p>
<p>the day, the kinda nerdy, cheesy, yet charming music with stupid lyrics that somehow end up making</p>
<p>a catchy sound that sticks in your head for years, and I hope they bring the fun videoclips to go</p>
<p>along with it, even if they're cheap, a lot of the fun in YFM was seeing the characters animating the</p>
<p>story they were telling through the music, and clips like Robot Bar Fight were a really fun watch</p>
<p>so I legitimately hope it goes well, and since they're making their official return in June 1</p>
<p>I made this tribute piece, with all of the Humberts/Puff Puffs celebrating their new start</p>
<p>it might not be perfect but it was made with love and care</p>
<p>so I hope you all enjoy it just as much as I enjoyed making it.</p>
<br>
<p>But anyways, that's about it, I'm going back to listening to Stalkin' Your Mom.</p>
<br>
<p>I hope you all are getting your moms done</p>
<p>I'll see you around suckers, it's been real.</p>

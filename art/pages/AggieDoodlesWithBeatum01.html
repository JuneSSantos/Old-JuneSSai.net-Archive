<h1>Author's Comment</h1>
<br>
<p>And here we are again, back at the disco, back at the flashing lights.</p>
<br>
<p>Oh yeah, there's new art stuff too, like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>And why does my artstyle look radically different and better than it did in</p>
<p>previous posts?</p>
<br>
<p>You buffoon, you fucking dumbass, can't you see I'm not the only one drawing?</p>
<p>That's right, baby, we have a guest today, and it's BeatumPopcorn, if you're still</p>
<p>dumb enough to not have figured that out yourself, dumbass. </p>
<br>
<p>I've been drawing a lot more recently, specially in Aggie.io's, mostly with people like</p>
<p>rameNwaterbottle and BeatumPopcorn, and that's mostly because they call me first, because</p>
<p>I'm usually too nervous to do it myself, but I like it quite a lot, even though I feel</p>
<p>EXTREMELY intimidated at doing anything with anyone with higher skills than me</p>
<br>
<p>Most of this Aggie.io session consisted of Dragon Ball and our little characters</p>
<p>I've ended up drawing (very poorly) an older Big Whiskey and his son Lil' Whiskey</p>
<p>and Beatum ended up changing him quite a bit so he doesn't just look like a smaller version</p>
<p>of Big Whiskey and actually stands apart a little more, and I really like that, even if it's</p>
<p>really hard to see it with the yellow brush he went with</p>
<p>There's also Big Whiskey with his hair tied, since Beatum asked why never ties his hair</p>
<br>
<p>And about the Dragon Ball stuff, to put it simply; I've been revisiting Dragon Ball recently</p>
<p>ever since I got PCSX2 to run properly on my computer and got the chance to revisit one of</p>
<p>my favorite games in the PS2 era; Dragon Ball: Infinite World, and I loved it just as much</p>
<p>as I did when I first played it back in the day, and with that, my love for all things</p>
<p>Dragon Ball came flying right back to me, and now I can't stop saying that "I'm the prince</p>
<p>of all Saiyans" everywhere I go with a stupid Vegeta voice</p>
<p>Also Mega64's Buu Saga video happened.</p>
<br>
<p>But that's about it, for real.</p>
<p>It was incredibly fun to draw with Beatum, and if you didn't got the chance to check any</p>
<p>of his artwork yet, you should head to the fanart section and look up the stuff he made</p>
<p>for me in there, and maybe even follow him on Newgrounds (badass) or Twitter (absolute shit)</p>
<p>but in the meanwhile, that's all I have for you, for now</p>
<p>I hope you're having a nice evening, or whatever</p>
<p>I'll see you at the end of the sunset</p>
<p>Till' we meet again.</p>

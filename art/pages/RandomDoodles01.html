<h1>Author's Comment</h1>
<p>Holy shit, it's been a while, hasn't it?</p>
<p>And here I am, once again, bringing you content, content to delight your eyes and your</p>
<p>thirst for creativity!... maybe.</p>
<br>
<p>Yeah, I've been getting back into art recently, and I didn't want it to go to waste like</p>
<p>I always do, so I decided to doodle and sketch some things, some of these I took my time</p>
<p>with them, like Lil' Whiskey and the Caira Doll, others, I just fucked around and did them</p>
<p>in a few minutes, but it was a fun thing to do, I really enjoyed what came from it, and I</p>
<p>might end up trying to finish more stuff too in the long run, I might even end up trying to</p>
<p>get back into pixelart, maybe even video editing, and I'm definitely going to go back to</p>
<p>writting things at some point or another, but this might take a while since I feel absolutely</p>
<p>drained due to a lot of factors, and I'll definitely explain why when I get the chance to sit</p>
<p>down and put all my thoughts down somewhere, but my head is so full I could barely muster up</p>
<p>energy to update the site, including the daily section, but I promise, I'll start to bring new</p>
<p>and fun content for you all soon, just give me a little bit of time.</p>
<br>
<p>I also posted this on Newgrounds, and there's a little bit more of lore for Lil' Whiskey in there</p>
<p>if you're interested, just click <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/art/view/junessai/random-doodles" class="hyperlink">here</a> 
to be sent there.</p>
<br>
<p>But that's about it, for now.</p>
<p>I hope you're all doing great as usual.</p>
<br>
<p>Peace out, suckers. It's been real.</p>

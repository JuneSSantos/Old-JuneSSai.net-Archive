<h1>Author's Comment</h1>
<p>Wow, this one took me quite a while to finish</p>
<p>And would you look at that? Another art in the style of The Binding Of Isaac!</p>
<br>
<p>I've made this for Beatum, since he's been so nice to me, and drew so many cool things recently</p>
<p>One of those drawings even got frontpaged, meaning that for the first time, Big Whiskey has</p>
<p>been featured in the frontpage! which honestly, is kinda based.</p>
<br>
<p>There's two things to notice from this piece, the first being the fact that I added his little</p>
<p>bird creature, and the second one is that the first piece I've made about Caira, also started</p>
<p>as a test in a different artstyle, using the TBOI's title screen pallete, so there's that too</p>
<br>
<p>It took me a lil' bit, but I made this with a lot of care, afterall, he deserves it</p>
<p>If you're all interested on his lil' character, or even if the description got you interested</p>
<p>on him, please, I urge you to look at his pages and his art, hop onto the fanart section and</p>
<p>check the stuff he made for me, and then check his social media, please, go lend him your support</p>
<br>
<p>But that's about it for now</p>
<p>Today has been a good day</p>
<p>Also, today's Pico Day... kinda... so yeah... happy Pico Day... I guess?... I don't know.</p>
<br>
<p>Either way, I hope you're having a nice night</p>
<p>Peace out, suckers; it's been real.</p>

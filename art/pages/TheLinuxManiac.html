<h1>Author's Comment</h1>
<p>Well, this one also took me quite a while</p>
<p>But this one was also made with a lot of care too!</p>
<br>
<p>Octo is this lil' fella I met in 2021, and although I've first heard of him</p>
<p>on Newgrounds due to his rotoscoped FNF' animation, the first time we truly</p>
<p>interacted with each other was ironically, on Twitter, a site we both despise</p>
<p>and that we'd eventually quit pretty much simultaneously</p>
<br>
<p>And ever since I met Octo, I've been introduced to so many cool things, I got</p>
<p>introduced to so many new people, and I've learned so many cool things</p>
<p>In fact, most of the stuff I like doing nowadays is pretty much because of him</p>
<p>either directly or indirectly</p>
<br>
<p>Octo got my interest on Linux to peak, eventually making me do the full switch</p>
<p>to Artix Linux once I got tired of Windows' bullshit</p>
<p>Octo got me to give Quake a chance after I had such a weird dislike towards it</p>
<p>And now, it's something I play on a daily basis and pretty much inspires my</p>
<p>style and preferences a lot, and he also made me remember my love towards Worms</p>
<p>so there's that too</p>
<p>Octo got me into this cool group that introduced me to so many cool friends</p>
<p>real ones that I talk and interact on a daily basis, and have been a big</p>
<p>highlight in my life, specially in recent years</p>
<p>Hell, this site itself, including some of it's features only exist because of</p>
<p>Octo, because his websites really resonated with me, and that inspired me to</p>
<p>seek to create my own</p>
<br>
<p>Octo's will be a big fucking meanie and call you racial slurs at the first chance</p>
<p>he gets, but he's a real one, the type of friend I've been asking for my whole life</p>
<p>and I'm glad we've come across each other, and the more I sit and think about it</p>
<p>This little fella' did a lot for me, so this is a way of saying</p>
<p>"Thanks for being a little rascal, and a great friend"</p>
<br>
<p>Octo's a real one, so are you.</p>
<br>
<p>I also plan to make more art of my friends, specially those who reached to me during</p>
<p>the fucked up episode I had a while ago, so keep in tune for more</p>
<br>
<p>I hope you're all having a great day</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

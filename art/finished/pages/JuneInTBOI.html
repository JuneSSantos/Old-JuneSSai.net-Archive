<h1>Author's Comment</h1>
<p>This was a thing I made a while ago during the hype for Repentance's launch</p>
<p>It was an attempt to recreate my lil' character in the style of TBOI</p>
<p>And honestly, I think I did a pretty good job with it</p>
<p>Might not be my most detailed piece, but it's definitely one of my favorites</p>

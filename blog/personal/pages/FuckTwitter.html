<h1>Fuck Twitter</h1>
<p>Posted on July 3, 2022</p>
<p>Last updated on July 3, 2022</p>
<br>
<p>Kept you waiting, huh?</p>
<br>
<p>I can't believe I'm doing one of these again after so long, but I'm glad I am, because today</p>
<p>we're going to be talking about something I'm very passionate about for all of the wrong reasons</p>
<p>Social Medias, most specifically, Twitter.</p>
<br>
<p>My distaste for social medias has been made clear multiple times, not only on my website like in</p>
<p>the "Early 2000's Internet" blog post and even on my Newgrounds account, but everyone who had the</p>
<p>displeasure of knowing me personally knows how much I despise social medias, with most of this</p>
<p>fierce hate going towards Twitter, and for a little time, I tried giving Twitter a chance once</p>
<p>once again after such a long time, specially since a lot of time has passed, and a lot has changed</p>
<p>including me, and maybe giving it a chance again could give me a different perspective on things</p>
<br>
<p>It fucking didn't, all it did was to remind me why I despise that place to begin with.</p>
<br>
<p>Let's start with arguably the least offensive thing about Twitter; the site design</p>
<p>One of the main reasons why I even made my own website to begin with was to spite on every single</p>
<p>lazy and uninspired site out there that decided that having no personality nor intuitive navigation</p>
<p>was a good idea just because everyone else is doing it too (AKA corporate designs/logos)</p>
<p>Let's make one thing clear; I don't hate simplicity, in fact, I love it, just because you're</p>
<p>streamlining things and cutting the unecessary fat doesn't mean you're making things dull, in fact</p>
<p>it can be quite beneficial to a lot of things, such as designing websites or even creating character</p>
<p>designs, but what I hate is when people strip features or personality out of something either because</p>
<p>everyone else is doing it, or because they're too lazy to come up with something new or creative</p>
<br>
<p>Simplicity is not the problem, lazyness is.</p>
<br>
<p>And Twitter's design (and by extension sites like Facebook and Instagram) is absolute god awful</p>
<p>both in terms of how they look and how you navigate through them</p>
<p>First; everything looks absolutely bland, no personality at all, the most amount of personality</p>
<p>you'll see on the site is the fact you can change the color of the buttons and go into dark mode</p>
<p>Yeah, you can still put a profile picture, cover and a bio, but that's something that every site</p>
<p>in the goddamn existence has, and Twitter does the bare minimum</p>
<br>
<p>What's that? You want to put more than one link in your profile, because maybe not only you have</p>
<p>more than one website or platform, but it's just a nice thing to have? Tough luck, dumbass!</p>
<p>You'll either have to create some shit like a linktr.ee or make place for a pinned post that you</p>
<p>might already be using for stuff like comission sheets, which sucks</p>
<p>is it really that hard to add an option to add more than one website on your profile?</p>
<br>
<p>Newgrounds, however, let's you add up to 10 links on your page, and they can all be easily found</p>
<p>on your profile, and not only that, but you can also edit and give the links actual names so they're</p>
<p>not only displaying the URL, but an actual title or explanation of what the website linked is used for</p>
<p>AND IT DOESN'T END THERE, you can actually change so much about your experience on the website</p>
<p>like filtering content you'd like to see, from SFW and NSFW content, to tags and things you wouldn't</p>
<p>like to stumble upon, from the way you page looks not only for you, but for everyone that visits it</p>
<p>by giving pages a lot of color options, from the background color, header color and even the links</p>
<p>YOU CAN EVEN CHANGE THE SHAPE OF YOUR PROFILE ICON, A FEATURE THAT MORE SITES</p>
<p>DESPERATELY NEED TO IMPLEMENT.</p>
<p>Yeah, you do need to pay for NG Supporter in order to change the shape of your icon or your level badge</p>
<p>but everything else is pretty much free, it gives you a lot of things to make your page unique from any</p>
<p>other, even allowing you to put custom pronouns if you're into this sort of shit, which allows you to get</p> 
<p>REALLY WACKY with your profile</p>
<p>and even with all of that, Newgrounds is just oozing with colors and life, the first thing you see when</p>
<p>you get into the site are cool site backgrounds made by talented users that shows everything the site is</p>
<p>all about or the current thing that's happening in the community right now, such as Pico Day</p>
<p>and navigating through it isn't difficult at all too, it's very simple and straightforward to use it</p>
<p>everything you need to find is either in your own profile or even in front of your face, it doesn't</p>
<p>fill the site with useless features like Lists, Explore or any of this bullshit, it's just the necessary</p>
<p>and a little bit more, so why can't the other sites be like that too?</p>
<br>
<p>Going a little bit outside of the profiles and customization, the way your feed works is so obnoxious</p>
<p>You followed an artist because you thought their art is cool? Have fun having your timeline filled with</p>
<p>useless retweets and quote retweets about some shit you don't care about, or you see an unwanted post on</p>
<p>your feed because the same artist liked that one post or because they replied to it, and even after you</p>
<p>mute them, unwanted shit still pops out in your feed because Twitter keeps recommending you tags and</p>
<p>annoying garbage "based on your likings" even though you already clicked to dismiss it countless times</p>
<br>
<p>Filtering your timeline on Twitter is fucking annoying, and even scrolling through the medias of someone</p>
<p>when trying to find their art is unecessarily awful because they don't show only the stuff they posted</p>
<p>directly into their timeline, they show all of the images and videos they posted THROUGH THE ENTIRETY</p>
<p>OF THE SITE, INCLUDING REPLIES, making the media tab incredibly convoluted and obnoxious to scroll</p>
<p>take all of that in consideration, with the fact that even when you follow someone specifically for</p>
<p>their art, you're still going to have your feed invaded with unwanted shit like shitty political takes</p>
<p>because filtering stuff on Twitter is a fucking shore</p>
<br>
<p>But that isn't even with the worst part about it</p>
<p>Let's talk about the users and the moderation of the site</p>
<br>
<p>The people using Twitter are, in the best way to put it; insufferable and stupid</p>
<p>You'll get into arguments for the stupidest shit you could ever imagine, like how someone got mad at me</p>
<p>because I said that Sonic.EXE OCs are the laziest shit, and I stumbled upon them on about five different</p>
<p>posts about the same topic, trying their hardest to defend what's essentially a shitty creepypasta</p>
<p>or how people will obsess and go crazy over the unfunniest shit of the moment, and you'll see the same</p>
<p>thing on your feed every few seconds to the point that even if you initially found it funny, you'll end</p>
<p>up hating it because of how people drive the joke into the fucking ground</p>
<p>The worst thing is that the concepts of opinions are non-existant in there</p>
<p>This sounds like an exaggeration, but people will get genuinely irate  at you because you said you don't</p>
<p>like a certain thing or a certain someone, to the point they'll legitimately turn any situatio that</p>
<p>could be solved privately into a shitshow for no fucking reason at all besides the fact they don't</p>
<p>know how to handle situations like a functioning human being, so they decide that turning anything</p>
<p>and everything into a school drama is the only way to handle things</p>
<br>
<p>But would you believe me if I told you that's not even the worst part?</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the genuinely awful moderation in there</p>
<br>
<p>First of all; let's keep in mind that the unfunny tesla man said that when he bought the plaftorm</p>
<p>he'd give everyone the right to speak freely, and I know I shouldn't be surprised about a rich guy</p>
<p>lying on the internet, that's the expected, but I at least expected the slightest of improvements</p>
<p>either on the bans or the systems surrounding them, but somehow, I think it only got fucking worse</p>
<br>
<p>It's okay to make a mob to cancel someone (which by the way, stop being a fucking moron, cancellation</p>
<p>does jackshit to the person you're trying to cancel besides give them even more attention, the complete</p>
<p>opposite of what you're trying to achieve when trying to cancel someone, you fucking retard) but when</p>
<p>I tell a random guy to kill himself on his replies, my account is instantly locked</p>
<p>I'm sorry, how the fuck is a rando telling you to kill yourself on your replies somehow gets you in</p>
<p>trouble while a guy trying to make a mob to essentially ruin someone's life doesn't even land them a</p>
<p>slap on their shoulders? and honestly, if you can't handle some random guy on Twitter telling you to</p>
<p>kill yourself, when you have multiple options to choose from, from ignoring, blocking them, or doing</p>
<p>like any sane person would and just not give a shit, you definitely shouldn't on the internet, period.</p>
<br>
<p>But it gets worse.</p>
<br>
<p>A few hours ago, some random guy was saying some schizo shit on a post because an FnF' mod didn't had</p>
<p>any lore on it, you know, basic FnF' fan type of shit, and I legitimately just said;</p>
<p>"its a fucking mod you schizo you it doesn't need to be that deep lmao"</p>
<p>And I moved on with my night.</p>
<br>
<p>That is, until an hour later, when I got notified that my account got locked for 11 hours</p>
<p>For calling someone, a schizo.</p>
<br>
<p>I was already pretty pissed about the fact that I got locked out of my account for no good reason</p>
<p>but I was still willing to give the site a chance, I could wait, specially since I could still</p>
<p>scroll through my timeline afterall, and after 11 hours, everything would be fine</p>
<br>
<p>Except the fact that when I tried to like a post, it didn't allow me, because my account was suspended</p>
<p>YOU CAN'T LIKE ANY POSTS, IF YOUR ACCOUNT IS SUSPENDED, EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE STILL FULLY CAPABLE</p>
<p>OF SCROLLING THROUGH EVERYTHING ON TWITTER NORMALLY</p>
<p>I'd be absolutely fine if I couldn't comment or quote retweet anything, but the fact that a basic</p>
<p>and harmless feature is locked away from you legitimately disgusts me</p>
<p>Imagine getting banned from reviewing on Newgrounds for a week, and out of the sudden, you're unable</p>
<p>to vote or favorite anything on the site. do you see how fucking ridiculous it is?</p>
<br>
<p>And you might be here thinking; "W-well, you shouldn't be mean, it costs 0 dollars to not be a dick"</p>
<p>Guess what dipshit, it's also free to be an asshole, and at times, it's way more fun than not being one.</p>
<br>
<p>I always hated this kind of mentality, the "always be positive and never voice your opinions if you're</p>
<p>being negative in the slightest, even if what you're saying is valid criticism or not"</p>
<p>Always being positive is not a good thing, we need negativity in our lifes in order to improve, there's</p>
<p>many times that negative opinions/criticism will help you far more than someone patting you on the back</p>
<p>for being mediocre, there's at times that an "asshole" might bring valid points that might genuinely</p>
<p>help tons of other people because all of the "nice ones" were afraid to voice what they were really</p>
<p>thinking, and even if you don't like what the other is saying, even if you think that the other person</p>
<p>is being too mean, you still shouldn't shut them down</p>
<br>
<p>Everyone should have the right to speak their mind, no matter if you like it, are offended by it or not</p>
<p>It's why our world is so interesting, it's how new ideas are formed and how we evolve as people</p>
<p>and there's a lot of things that I think that are absolutely ridiculous, things that legitimately piss</p>
<p>me off due to how dumb they are, and yet, I don't think anybody deserves to be censored just because</p>
<p>"I" find it stupid, because if I was going by that logic, other people should be able to do the same</p>
<p>the same with me and instantly dismiss anything I said because they simply don't like it</p>
<p>I can challenge them, have a discussion, try to change their views or even just straight up ignore them</p>
<p>but the moment I try and shut them down is the moment I fail as everything a human being should be</p>
<p>creatures that are constantly evolving, and you won't evolve by living in an echo chamber, you evolve</p>
<p>through life experiences and interactions that challenge you, and if there's no challenge, what's even</p>
<p>the point of existance, when everything is safe and there's no stakes in anything you do or say?</p>
<br>
<p>Am I saying that you should be free of consequences for the things you say? Fuck no.</p>
<p>If you try and call some random guy in the street a faggot, you shouldn't be surprised if you ever</p>
<p>find yourself missing a few teeths, or even wind up dead.</p>
<p>You should be free to say whatever you want, but remember that consequences still exist.</p>
<br>
<p>This kind of shit just made me appreciate places like Newgrounds even more, because even though</p>
<p>Newgrounds has a lot of problems on itself when it comes to a lot of the new users and the current</p>
<p>moderation, but at the same time, you barely have to hold yourself back, if ever.</p>
<p>One of my friends straight up does nothing but be mean and zero bomb submissions on the reviews</p>
<p>and yet most if not all of his reviews are still there, with the few that actually got removed</p>
<p>was straight up because he dropped a racial slur or two in there, but he's still there, doing</p>
<p>god's work and being mean to people on the reviews, god bless america (i dont live there idk)</p>
<p>In general, I feel like Twitter limits individuality a lot. I understand why people use it, specially</p>
<p>since if you need to promote your stuff or make it big in the art world, you most likely need the</p>
<p>audience from there, but I feel like in many ways, you have to drop whatever you want to do and force</p>
<p>yourself to do what everyone else is doing in order to have any ounce of success in there</p>
<p>while I feel if you meet the right people on Newgrounds or even if just a random guy stumbles upon</p>
<p>your submission and puts it on the frontpage suggestion, you have a chance to be the next big name</p>
<p>in there, everyone feels equal, like we all have the opportunity to shine for doing our own things</p>
<p>instead of trying to ride the wave like everyone else is</p>
<p>I don't want to call anyone a hack for hustling out there, at times you gotta do what you gotta do</p>
<p>and you're not a bad person for doing so, but seeing people limiting themselves because of numbers</p>
<p>will never sadden me</p>
<br>
<p>So, after all of these terrible experiences, I just deactivated my account, and quitted</p>
<p>Ironically, the event that led to me deactivating my account, happened a day before my birthday</p>
<p>In a way, it feels weirdly "ironic", I think that's the word I'm looking for</p>
<br>
<p>I'm now 21 at the time of posting this</p>
<p>I'm pretty much the same thing, and barely anything will change in my life, but it's still</p>
<p>a new chapter in my life nonetheless, new opportunities to get dissapointed at, new enemies to</p>
<p>to be made, and harder times to face, all of that, and the fact I'm now legally allowed to drink</p>
<p>in the states, but that's about it, it's just another day, and an unfortunate reminder that I still</p>
<p>have a lot to live and die for</p>
<p>I'm not sure what I want for me or for my life yet, but I'm going to make it happen, probably.</p>
<br>
<p>But, once again, we hit a roadblock</p>
<p>There's more tomorrow, there's more to come</p>
<p>We'll see each other again on the other side of the road</p>
<p>Until then, take it easy
<p>I regret nothing.</p>

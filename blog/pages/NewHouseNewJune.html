<p>It's done.</p>
<p>June living under shitty conditions and around awful people is no more.</p>
<p>I've made it, I finally moved out of my old house into a new one.</p>
<br>
<p>Although I'll probably have to make more visits into my old house in order to get the</p>
<p>remaining stuff I left there, and also because I sincerely miss my chickens, even though</p>
<p>it's been barely a day.</p>
<br> 
<p>But besides that, everything's good, if not great now</p>
<p>I have a better space to work, enjoy myself, and live at</p>
<p>And that's sincerely all I could ask for</p>
<br>
<p>Let's hope for a better future now</p>
<p>I'll see you around the corner</p>
<p>-June S. Sai</p>

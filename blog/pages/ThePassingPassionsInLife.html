<h1>The Passing Passions In Life</h1>
<p>Posted on April 21, 2022</p>
<p>Last updated on April 21, 2022</p>
<br>
<p>Well, it's been a while, but here it is, another blog post!</p>
<br>
<p>Now, you're probably thinking</p>
<p>"Wow, the site didn't get any meaningful updates in a good while, he's either very lazy</p>
<p>or he just straight up gave on the website after such a short time."</p>
<br>
<p>And the first part is kinda true, but there's so much going on in my life right now</p>
<p>And some of these things are actually pretty good, fortunately. I had a lot of time to</p>
<p>enjoy my time and myself, and one of the people I hated the most in here actually moved</p>
<p>moved away, and things have been looking up since then, not only that, but if I get a job</p>
<p>I might be able to take this house for myself, thus allowing for more liberty and a cleaner</p>
<p>enviroment to work around with anything I want, so things have been pretty good as of recently</p>
<p>Which is a very good contrast in comparision to a few weeks ago when I was feeling absolutely</p>
<p>destroyed. Things aren't perfect now, but at least it's something, it's all I could ask for.</p>
<br>
<p>But if I'm finally alone, and I'm feeling good, why don't I write more? Why isn't there any</p>
<p>new art or even new projects? Why the updates have stagnated so much as of recently?</p>
<br>
<p>And well, it's hard to explain, but it's something that happens with everyone at some point</p>
<p>or another in their lifes, at times, it happens at multiple points in their lifes</p>
<p>Which is that period in life where you don't know what you want for your future</p>
<p>When you don't know what you're doing or what you want to do anymore</p>
<p>When you're losing your passions, or your passion is just shifting away to other things</p>
<br>
<p>I've been sitting blankly at my screen at any attempts I've been making on trying to produce</p>
<p>new content, and it's not because I don't want to, but things are not clicking anymore, they</p>
<p>don't feel like second nature to me anymore, and it's been throwing me off really badly</p>
<p>Yes, I've been updating the site on a daily basis, since the daily stuff is updated by hand</p>
<p>But when it comes to actual content like new posts, new art or even new features, I've hit</p>
<p>a brick wall that simply refuses to break down, no matter how many hammers I slam into it</p>
<p>and the thing is, I could just start posting random thoughts and just typing random shit</p>
<p>into VIM and upload it to the site just for the sake of new content, but I always hated that</p>
<p>Everything I do, either it's mediocre or not, always has passion and effort into it, and if</p>
<p>I feel like I could do better, then I will, and I kinda refuse to post or do things unless</p>
<p>I put my all into it, and if I just started posting ramblings just for the sake of increasing</p>
<p>updates or the blog posts count, it wouldn't feel right, so I've been trying a lot to come up</p>
<p>with interesting shit to say, or even new ideas to bring to the site, but my mind right now</p>
<p>is a blank, which is not exactly a bad thing, but it doesn't help a lot either</p>
<br>
<p>But honestly, that's just a thing with life</p>
<p>Things just change, and the things you like following or even doing at one point just don't</p>
<p>feel like they fit you anymore, so you try to see why it's not working anymore, you force</p>
<p>yourself to try and enjoy it like you did back then, and it just doesn't work, so you just</p>
<p>move on, and try to do other things you might end up enjoying to fill the blank, yet at the</p>
<p>same time, you still feel like there's something missing, that maybe if you try harder, you</p>
<p>might end up getting it to work again, but at times, it's just a lost cause, and there's</p>
<p>little to nothing you can do about it</p>
<br>
<p>This goes for everything, from the things you like doing, the clothes you like to wear</p>
<p>The people you hang out with, and even the people you feel attracted towards</p>
<br>
<p>When you find a new passion, or even when you just feel like you've found that certain</p>
<p>someone, things just start to look and feel a little bit better, on that moment, you</p>
<p>get in your head that "this is where I want to go, this is what I want to do" and you just</p>
<p>just go along with it, but as the time goes on, things slow down, like everything in life does</p>
<p>And you just can't help but notice that things feel a little bit off, so you naturally try to</p>
<p>add new twists to old things, or even start to question yourself if what you have in mind right</p>
<p>now is really what you want for yourself in the long run, just like when working on a big</p>
<p>project, when you're first coming with ideas, everything looks and feels incredible, but once</p>
<p>things slow down and you start looking more into it, you just end up slowly losing interest on it</p>
<p>and you either slow things down, or just give up on the idea entirely</p>
<p>Once the adrenaline dries out, reality couldn't match what you were imagining while daydreaming</p>
<br>
<p>And you're probably thinking right now</p>
<p>"Well, if you lost the passion for it, it wasn't passion to begin with"</p>
<br>
<p>And I disagree, this notion of "if you stop loving it, you never loved it to begin with" will</p>
<p>always be bullshit to me since it pretty muich goes against everything us as species go by</p>
<br>
<p>We're ever-changing, always moving and always shifting, either our ideas, our interests</p>
<p>our passions, the people we hang out with, the way we act, the way we talk, our perception</p>
<p>of the world, and of ourselves, we're always changing about ourselves and our lifes</p>
<p>even if you don't notice, it's happening</p>
<p>And that kinda plays exactly with the topic of changing or straight up losing passions</p>
<br>
<p>In recent times, I've stopped calling myself an artist, and now I consider myself a writter</p>
<p>and I've said multiple times that I'd just give up on art entirely and never look back into it</p>
<p>because I felt my works simply didn't reflect my interest and my person, and no matter how much</p>
<p>I tried to change this, it simply did not work. but with writting, however, everything just clicked</p>
<p>It was the perfect way to show myself to the world, and the type of person I am, and at one point</p>
<p>I felt like this was simply my calling, this is what I was meant to do in life, I've always been</p>
<p>pretty verbose afterall, so instead of trying to focus on multiple things at the same time</p>
<p>I decided to leave art behind, and for a good while now, I haven't even tried to open a art program</p>
<p>and I've been either writting a lot of stuff, or just making stuff on HTML and CSS, and at others</p>
<p>I'd just be learning how to use the Linux Terminal and how to mess around with Linux features when</p>
<p>I had nothing better to do, and I've been pretty happy doing things, all things considered</p>
<p>However, ever since I met this one person, he inspired me to try and do art again, specially since</p>
<p>when talking with him, I was fumbling with my old tablet and I somehow, the thought of reading</p>
<p>instructions didn't go through my head before, so I did just that and I got it working again</p>
<p>And after a good while, I got my first real piece finished after a good while, and weirdly enough</p>
<p>I felt that weird urge to just fuck around with art once again, and I've been working on some stuff</p>
<p>on the background lately, but when it comes to writting, I've been just stuck in the same place</p>
<p>ever since, unable to find anything new and interesting to say</p>
<p>and this instantly reminded of the time I gave up on art, because I was unable to work or feel the</p>
<p>urge to sit down and draw anything anymore, now the same was happening again, except with writting</p>
<br>
<p>Maybe I just operate better in bringing new ideas when I'm feeling down</p>
<p>Maybe it's another slow week</p>
<p>Maybe that's just how it is</p>
<br>
<p>We're always moving and changing, for the most part, at least for me, not for the better</p>
<p>At one point, even your biggest passion can't cheer you up anymore, you start to feel like the</p>
<p>person you are, and the way you act simply do not fit your being anymore, and even the type of</p>
<p>people you like or even end up developing something for, just lose that magic they had in them</p>
<p>Doesn't mean you don't like doing these things, or even that you just gave up on people</p>
<p>Hell, it doesn't even mean you wouldn't want to try and start something with them anymore</p>
<p>But the magic either just doesn't feel the same, or it's just gone, and we either try again</p>
<p>or we simply just give up and move on, either because we changed or because things changed</p>
<br>
<p>And honestly, that's ok.</p>
<br>
<p>The world is interesting as it is because of the fact life and everything surrounding it is</p>
<p>changing on a daily basis, either we see it or don't</p>
<p>These developments keeps things interesting, and some of them end up being something truly</p>
<p>special in the long run, it might not be exactly what we wanted, but it might end up being</p>
<p>exactly what we needed</p>
<br>
<p>It's not good to wear rose-tinted glasses anyways</p>
<br>
<p>It's been a while, suckers</p>
<p>I've missed you all just as much as you've missed me</p>
<p>I'll try to bring some good stuff later, but as of now, trying is the best I can do</p>
<p>Feel free to call or contact me if you want, I'd love to hear from you</p>
<br>
<p>Until then, I hope you're having a good day</p>
<p>Peace be with you.</p>

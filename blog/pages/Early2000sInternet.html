<h1>The comfy feeling of the early 2000s internet</h1>
<h1>And why I miss the decentralized era of the internet</h1>
<br>
<p>Wow, my first post, finally!</p>
<p>And what a better way to start it than talking about what inspired me to learn HTML/CSS</p>
<p>and make this website to begin with, and in general, helped me shape the person I am</p>
<p>today? (I'm not sure if that's a good or a bad thing, but whatever.)</p>
<br>
<p>Internet in the early 2000's, an era where the internet was still seen as a novelty</p>
<p>rather than a game changer, something we'd NEED in our lifes on a daily basis, where instead of</p>
<p>relying on big companies or websites for everything, you'd go into some random forum where some guy</p>
<p>called "DickMaster445" on the "MegaDoom XL Forums" would explain you how to add a WAD file to your game</p>
<p>Or alternatively, when a kid that just so happens to know what he's doing makes a video in 144p with</p>
<p>Unregistered Hypercam 2 to record his notepad while "Trance - 009 Sound System Dreamscape" is blasting</p>
<p>on the background, yet somehow, most of the time, that would be enough to solve whatever</p>
<p>problem you were having, or to teach you something you didn't knew before</p>
<p>Or you'd just watch it because you had nothing better to do, and it was just fun to do so.</p>
<br>
<p>Those were the great times.</p>
<p>It was a time for discovery and fun, where nobody really gave a shit about their image (except for</p>
<p>a few losers) and all people were focused on was having a good time with people online</p>
<p>either they be friends or strangers, the possibilities and potential were endless</p>
<br>
<p>But that's in the past, those were different times.
<p>Times that will never come back, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Why though? Is it because nobody wants it back anymore? What we have nowadays is better?</p>
<p>The answer is a little bit more complicated the more you try to think about it.</p>
<p>And it's mostly connected on how the internet evolved, and how the people who use it devolved.</p>
<br>
<p>And what do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Buckle up, buddy.</p>
<p>We're going down the memory lane.</p>
<br>
<img src="../../blog/pages/images/Early2000sInternet/EarlyHomeComputers.jpg" width="600" height="500">
<br>
<p>As I've pointed out in the beginning of this post, when the first home computers were</p>
<p>introduced to the world, they were seem as nothing more than a simple novelty</p>
<p>mostly made for office jobs, like excels, docs, emails</p>
<p>and things among those lines, and I think this was specially true with things like emails.</p>
<br>
<p>Nowadays, things like instant messages, having calls or even sending emails is</p>
<p>something incredibly superficial anybody can learn how to do these things in about a minute</p>
<p>and with increased internet speeds, these types of tasks aren't really a problem anymore</p>
<p>since sending and receiving files takes about the same time you'd take reading</p>
<p>a single paragraph of this post, if not faster</p>
<p>But that's the thing, "Nowadays", but back then, not only internet connections were way slower</p>
<p>but that was a new technology being introduced to the world it was revolutionary.</p>
<br>
<p>Distance didn't seem like a problem anymore, and barriers were quickly being broken</p>
<p>as people started to explore the possibilities with these new tools, a new world was opened</p>
<p>not only for those seeking to be professionals, but for those who were eager to explore</p>
<p>and find new things, new cultures, new people, new everything.</p>
<br>
<p>first era of the internet was a golden age of curiosity and discovery, and once people started</p>
<p>to hear about the things the internet could do and offer you, everyone was eager to be a part of it</p>
<br>
<img src="../../blog/pages/images/Early2000sInternet/GeoCitiesExample1.jpg">
<br>
<p>People started to use internet and their home computers for more than just work</p>
<p>they started to use it for their own entertainment, and suddenly, the internet started to develop</p>
<p>it's identity, a place where you could do anything, create anything, post anything, share anything</p>
<p>it was like the wild west, what you were going to do with it and who you were going to be</p>
<p>on the internet was all up to you.</p>
<br>
<p>The internet started to gain a personal touch that's pretty much lost nowadays</p>
<p>and that was mostly prominent on sites like GeoCities, where users would make their own web pages</p>
<p>They would either be like a personal page, or something completely random</p>
<p>at times being a incoherent mess filled with gifs and vivid colors</p>
<p>And man, was it cool.</p>
<br>
<img src="../../blog/pages/images/Early2000sInternet/GeoCitiesExample2.png">
<br>
<p>And now you're probably asking; "Uhm, are you sure? Are you sure you're not blinded by nostalgia</p>
<p>and it's making you have a poor judgement over something that probably wasn't</p>
<p>even that good to begin with?"</p>
<br>
<p>And to that, I say "No".
<br>
<p>These old webpages were absolutely awesome, and they were a huge part on</p>
<p>why surfing the web was so fun</p>
<br>
<p>Most of the might have been pretty amateur-ish, and even a mess, but every page had</p>
<p>it's own distinct feeling, no page was the same, they all had a personal touch to them, even if</p>
<p>they shared the same ideas or focuses, something would always make them memorable and unique</p>
<p>among the crowd, either because of how the pages were built, the content they had, or just</p>
<p>because of how the person that created them wrote and did things in it</p>
<p>And this personal touch allowed people to create all sorts of sites, either to post and</p>
<p>talk about things they liked, or things they didn't, or just because they could, and with that</p>
<p>people would be inspired to create and share things themselves, and that got us a lot of fun</p>
<p>and creative stuff, like videogame websites, tutorial websites, fun and random websites, and</p>
<p>even sites centered around user creations, with some of them still being a thing even nowadays</p>
<p>like Newgrounds, although Newgrounds didn't allow users to share content when it first came out</p>
<p>although that would quickly change, with it being one of the main participants on the</p>
<p>culture of creating and sharing your creations on the internet.</p>
<br>
<img src="../../blog/pages/images/Early2000sInternet/GeoCitiesExample3.jpg">
<br>
<p>And I cannot overstate how amazing this was back in the day</p>
<p>Out of nowhere, a lot of people that simply didn't fit well anywhere, either because the things</p>
<p>they enjoyed, the way they acted or the things they created were heavily judged and ostracized</p>
<p>from most if not all circles, but not anymore.</p>
<br>
<p>Now everyone could have their own little spaces, their own groups, and for once, feel like</p>
<p>they belong to somewhere.</p>
<br>
<p>And things didn't slow down there, since forums and online chats would quickly rise into popularity</p>
<p>not only allowing for more freedom on what and where to share, but to interact with people in</p>
<p>real time either by text communication, or even voice and video calls, and there was plenty of choices</p>
<p>to choose from, either it was IRC, Mumble, MSN, Skype, Xat, Forums, it was all up to you.</p>
<br>
<img src="../../blog/pages/images/Early2000sInternet/XatExample.jpg" width="600" height="500">
<br>
<img src="../../blog/pages/images/Early2000sInternet/Doomworld2009.png" width="600" height="500">
<br>
<p>It was an amazing time to interact and make friendships, or just meet all sorts of weirdos</p>
<p>and one of the things I really miss from that era, is that people weren't trying to appeal to anybody</p>
<p>they were just being themselves and having fun, without a care in the world if people were happy</p>
<p>about it or not, and instead of being constantly worried about filtering everything they said or</p>
<p>moderating theirselves 24/7 so they wouldn't piss some random loser on social media that didn't</p>
<p>know what an opinion is, they would just do their thing, and let people do theirs.</p>
<br>
<p>Every personality was pretty much distinct from each other, you'd meet all sorts of people</p>
<p>either they were bad or not, and most if not all of these encounters would stick with you</p>
<p>and you'd be able to remember them just because of how much impact they left when you had</p>
<p>the chance to meet them, and I think this era of the internet was defined by one word</p>
<p>"Personality".</p>
<br>
<img src="../../blog/pages/images/Early2000sInternet/MysticalForestZone.png">
<br>
<p>From the people, to the sites, the music, the way internet was shaped and how people shaped it</p>
<p>it all felt really "personal", and everywhere you'd go, sites and the things you'd see in them</p>
<p>would stick to you, even years after you've first visited them, and I think one of the biggest</p>
<p>examples of this happening with me was with this site called "The Mystical Forest Zone"</p>
<br>
<p>It was a site where you'd download Sonic sprites, and you'd even have comic sections, and I'd</p>
<p>visit it daily, not only because I just loved looking at the sprites, or because I'd always</p>
<p>download them so I could make my shitty Sonic comics on MSPaint, but because the site looked</p>
<p>and felt amazing, it was a weird feeling of comfort and wonder I cannot describe correctly</p>
<p>and even going back to it nowadays wakes something up in me, and that goes for basicly</p>
<p>everything made at that period in time</p>
<br>
<p>People would make things for themselves before anything or anyone else</p>
<p>Sharing with others was just a part of the fun, but not the whole point or the whole fun itself</p>
<br>
<p>And that allowed things to feel more unique from each other, with everyone having something
<p>distinct about them and their works, and yes, of course people copied each other from time</p>
<p>but you'd still be able to tell what or who they were copying just because of how memorable</p>
<p>some of these personalities were, and I think there is a certain beauty to that, to know</p>
<p>that the things you did or just you being yourself, was enough to make you special in</p>
<p>else's eyes, even if you're just another stranger on the internet, or the fact you've never</p>
<p>met this person in your life, and probably never will either</p>
<p>and I think that turned specially true when YouTube got into the scene and it started growing</p>
<p>in popularity, becoming one of the most beloved sites in the world.</p>
<br>
<img src="../../blog/pages/images/Early2000sInternet/OldYouTube1.jpg" width="600" height="500">
<br>
<p>Broadcast yourself, because you were the star</p>
<p>YouTube was something else back in the day.</p>
<br>
<p>Since YouTube was a small site at that time, anyone would get a chance to be at the spotlight</p>
<p>and you'd never run out of fun things to see, because instead of only giving the spotlight to very</p>
<p>few creators like how you see nowadays, you'd see new faces daily, and the videos you'd find where</p>
<p>incredibly interesting, not only because of how chaotic and random some of them were, but because</p>
<p>of the wild ideas some of these videos had</p>
<br>
<p>And I think that was specially the sprite videos with videogame characters, most specifically</p>
<p>Sonic characters living normal lifes with wacky shenanigans happening in each episode, with</p>
<p>real life photographs as backgrounds, all of them made in movie maker, essentially as a</p>
<p>slideshow and using that old Windows XP voice to voice every character in the video</p>
<p>And man, I loved those.</p>
<br>
<img src="../../blog/pages/images/Early2000sInternet/OldSonicVideos.png" width="600" height="500">
<br>
<p>You'd see some truly crazy videos like "Sonic & Shadow's Halloween", "Amy and the cloning machine"</p>
<p>"Silver falls in love with black yoshi", and things among those lines</p>
<br>
<p>and the best part out of all of that is that, all of these videos, no matter how ridiculous or</p>
<p>poorly made they were, they were legitimately some of the most fun you could had in the site</p>
<p>not only because they were legitimately funny due to how ridiculous they were, but because you</p>
<p>could tell just by watching the video that the person that made them was really enjoying making</p>
<p>enjoyed making those videos, and sharing was just another part of the fun</p>
<br>
<p>The fact most of the videos were all amateurish gave them a very unique feeling that's so hard</p>
<p>to recapture nowadays, specially since YouTube is a completely different beast nowadays</p>
<p>a beast that kills any chance of you having any semblance of success unless you force yourself</p>
<p>to do and create the things everyone else is doing</p>
<p>And this change on focus to "everyone else" before "yourself" in my opinion, would essentially kill</p>
<p>one of the things that made the internet so fun to access to begin with.</p>
<br>
<p>We've talked about the rise</p>
<p>Now we're going to talk about the fall.</p>
<br>
<img src="../../blog/pages/images/Early2000sInternet/TwitterAndFacebook.jpg" width="600" height="500">
<br>
<p>I've been mostly talking about how everything felt incredibly unique and "personal", how even the</p>
<p>the most boring of sites or aspects of the internet were still pretty memorable just because of how</p>
<p>wild everything was, and because of that "personal" touch everything had on old user pages and even</p>
<p>on the content people used to create and share, and with the rise of social media with the likes of</p>
<p>Twitter and Facebook around 2012-2014, social media would destroy most of the things internet and</p>
<p>the people using it from the beginning cultivated from the very beginning.</p>
<br>
<p>I'm just going to say this to set the tone; I HATE Social Media with a burning passion.</p>
<p>It's not only one of the biggest wastes of time, a breeding ground for some of the</p>
<p>most vile and disgusting human beings the planet had the displeasure of having, and the main culprit</p>
<p>for creating a horrible and depressing mentality, but it also destroyed and distorted a lot of the</p>
<p>things that made the internet such a fun time.</p>
<p>But before I get into the real meat, let's talk about "the corporization of the internet".</p>
<br>
<img src="../../blog/pages/images/Early2000sInternet/OldYouTube2.png" width="600" height="500">
<br>
<img src="../../blog/pages/images/Early2000sInternet/OldYouTube3.jpg" width="600" height="500">
<br>
<img src="../../blog/pages/images/Early2000sInternet/NewYouTube.png" width="600" height="500">
<br>
<p>Take a look at these three pictures</p>
<p>They're from two different periods, two of them being from 2006-2009, and one of them being from</p>
<p>2013 to 2022</p>
<br>
<p>Can you tell me what's wrong with one of these pictures?</p>
<p>Can you tell me why we went from something full of customization and personality, to a bland</p>
<p>sterile, boring, corporate piece of shit style, instead of evolving, we devolved?</p>
<p>That's the effect of the internet being corporized to death, which was something that became</p>
<p>a huge problem around 2013, and the problem still persists to this day</p>
<p>In fact, it has gotten worse in some areas, specially when it comes to stylization and web design.</p>
<br>
<img src="../../blog/pages/images/Early2000sInternet/OldRobloxSite.jpg" width="600" height="500">
<br>
<img src="../../blog/pages/images/Early2000sInternet/NewRobloxSite.png" width="600" height="500">
<br>
<p>Again, can you see what I'm trying to say with the examples above?</p>
<p>How being lifeless, bland and sucking the soul and fun of everything has become the standard?</p>
<br>
<p>And now you're probably going</p>
<p>"M-maybe they do that so it makes the site easier to navigate and understand?</p>
<br>
<p>The answer is no, they don't.</p>
<br>
<p>I'd be less irritated if that was the case, but the fact is; they only do that because it allows</p>
<p>them to be lazy, and because everyone else is doing it too, so it means it must be good!</p>
<br>
<p>Roblox site back in the day might have not been the best thing in the world, but not only it</p>
<p>looked very inviting, but navigating it was pretty good too, specially since you'd have game</p>
<p>categories which would allow you to quickly find games in the style you wanted to</p>
<p>If you want wild west, click the the Wild West category, if Sci-Fi, Sci-Fi category, and so on</p>
<br>
<p>But for some fucking reason, they removed the categories, and made their site not only one of</p>
<p>most dull looking things I've had the displeasure of seeing, but they also made it harder to</p>
<p>navigate for no good reason, but why? because they want to be lazy, and they don't give a shit</p>
<p>if their site or their game is barely functional, they don't want to spend the time and effort</p>
<p>on making something truly good, because that would take effort, and nowadays, effort is</p>
<p>something that rarely rewards you, no matter how good you might be at your job.</p>
<br>
<p>Now that we've talked about the death of personality on websites</p>
<p>Let's instead talk about the deadly mentality of social medias and modern age internet.</p>
<p>Buckle up, this one is a fucking doozey.</p>
<br>
<img src="../../blog/pages/images/Early2000sInternet/WojakOnCouch.jpg" width="600" height="500">
<br>
<p>You might have noticed how the tone of this post shifted quite a lot as it went on</p>
<p>from optimism and positivity, looking to praise things, instead of shitting on them</p>
<p>to going completely off the wall and being as negative and hopeless as I could get</p>
<br>
<p>And that's intentional.</p>
<p>Because that's exactly what happened with the internet and how people use it</p>
<p>From something you'd go in when you needed a break, when you wanted to have fun</p>
<p>do the things you liked doing, talking to people you actually want to be around</p>
<p>A way to relieve yourself from the stress of the real world</p>
<br>
<p>Now, it's the complete opposite.</p>
<p>You log in your computer, and you see people screaming at each other over nothing</p>
<br>
<p>People are turning their backs on their own friends over them saying stupid things and</p>
<p>having fun in private, like everyone does, but people don't care about friends anymore</p>
<p>they want to feel morally superior above anything else.</p>
<br>
<p>People that don't want to be criticized or have any discussions that challenge them or</p>
<p>or their views, blocking you or sending their brainless armies against you the moment</p>
<p>you decide to have an opinion that's not on par with "the standards"</p>
<br>
<p>A desperation for attention and to fit in, constantly shifting their opinions and</p>
<p>the person they are on a daily basis because they're desperate to catter towards everyone</p>
<p>instead of just being themselves and being happy about it</p>
<br>
<p>You get into social media hoping to see something that brings you up, something fun</p>
<p>but it's just a reminder that the world is gone to shit, and everyone else has a better</p>
<p>life than you'll ever have, and the worst part, they didn't even had to try to begin with.</p>
<br>
<p>Don't know what and who to trust, and people just go along with whatever they see or hear</p>
<p>Not caring if that's going to hurt someone over things they didn't do or even themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>Sharing and being online was a thing that I absolutely adored back in the day, but that's</p>
<p>also because most people knew how to differentiate "opinions" from "facts"</p>
<br>
<p>Of course, there was always that one guy that would hate you because your opinion was</p>
<p>different from his, but that's just one guy, a guy that probably nobody likes or gives</p>
<p>a shit about due to how insufferable being around him is</p>
<br>
<p>But besides that, back in the day, you'd disagree, challenge people with whatever was</p>
<p>in your mind, and people would just move on with their days even if someone got angry</p>
<p>with you yesterday, on the next day, they'd hit you on Skype or IRC so you could play</p>
<p>SRB2 or Doom with them, like friends would, you'd disagree and even fight, but things</p>
<p>would be okay either in the next day, or the next week, and it all felt pretty genuine.</p>
<br>
<p>but the concept of friendship, specially online ones, has been distorted to death</p>
<br>
<p>People nowadays won't hesitate on leaving you behind or pretend they never had anything</p>
<p>to do with you just because you might have said something stupid, or even offensive once</p>
<p>Some guy will look into your web history from a decade ago, and out of nowhere</p>
<p>everyone and the world is against you, because privacy is not a thing anymore.</p>
<p>and some people are unfortunate enough to have private things made public.</p>
<br>
<p>Independently of how much you evolved as a person, or how much your actions have spoken</p>
<p>more than the things you've said, it doesn't matter, people are desperate to make you fall</p>
<p>they'll go through horrible lenghts to make sure you'll stay down if they ever decide that</p>
<p>they don't like you, because respect is a archaic concept, nowhere to be found nowadays on</p>
<p>the current landscape, either it's online or offline.</p>
<br>
<p>And with that, people are afraid, afraid of doing the things they like doing</p>
<p>Afraid of saying the things they want to say, afraid of criticizing anything or anyone</p>
<br>
<p>Unless everyone else is doing it too.</p>
<p>Unless you're fine with people obsessing over you and following each and every step you do</p>
<p>waiting for an opportunity to strike you</p>
<p>Then individuality is dead.</p>
<br>
<p>Go into social media, most specifically Twitter, and you'll see the amount of people that</p>
<p>will bandwagoon over something or someone they didn't do their own researchs on</p>
<p>They won't bother to read or analyze things themselves, if the big person says they're bad</p>
<p>then everyone else is obligated to do the same, and god help you if you don't</p>
<br>
<p>There has been many examples of "friends" betraying each other on recent years, or just people</p>
<p>Being dishonest with each other, one of the examples I love bring up is the ProJared case</p>
<p>When his ex-wife told everyone that he was cheating on her, even though they were on a</p>
<p>open relationship, a lot of people came forward stating that ProJared was a pedophile</p>
<p>with their only evidence being "bro trust me", and although there was a lot of red flags</p>
<p>from the very beginning with all of these statements, people still decided that he should</p>
<p>be vilified</p>
<br>
<p>That is until his defense video came out, and it turns out, his wife pushed him to be with</p>
<p>the girl he was apparently "cheating" her with, and the minors lied about their own age</p>
<p>to send him nudes, and even thought they said he never asked them about their age, that was</p>
<p>quickly debunked with screencaps showing that ProJared did ask beforehand if they were 18</p>
<p>in which they responded that they were.</p>
<br>
<p>And just like that, another person had their name slandered, because people were just going</p>
<p>with whatever they heard, instead of forming their own opinions.</p>
<br>
<p>And out of nowhere, cancel culture was apparently not cool, that is, until another person got</p>
<p>exposed, then it was ok to just do the exact same thing people were criticizing two weeks ago</p>
<p>The concept of morals is essentially non-existant with social media, and the same goes for</p>
<p>criticism or opinions in general.</p>
<br>
<p>I shit you not, try criticizing, or simply disagreeing with a twitter user</p>
<p>specially those that pretend to be "Innocent and positive", and you'll either see them instantly</p>
<p>block you or instantly drop their facade, and either get extremely angry with you, or try making</p>
<p>the "beef" they're having with this random person a public thing, sending their braindead mob</p>
<p>against you, a random person on the internet, instead of solving things like functioning</p>
<p>human beings, which is another thing I hate about the internet and interacting with other people</p>
<p>on the current age, which is the fact that most people now are complete cowards, or that their</p>
<p>whole personality feels fabricated, either because they're afraid of backlash, or because</p>
<p>they're desperate to fit in every single group they possibly can</p>
<br>
<p>Remember how I was talking about the rise of the internet gave people the chance to show the world</p>
<p>your unique traits and personality that normally wouldn't fit anywhere?</p>
<p>How anybody could have a place in the world now, and they didn't had to pretend to be something or</p>
<p>someone they weren't anymore?</p>
<br>
<p>People are doing the exact fucking opposite now</p>
<p>Instead of trying to be themselves, they're constantly shapeshifting and deforming their views and</p>
<p>personalities in an attempt to appeal to the masses</p>
<br>
<p>And no, I don't have a problem with people changing or evolving, I don't expect, and I don't want</p>
<p>people to be the same thing forever, it's just a part of human nature, but that should be natural</p>
<p>something that happens gradually, instead of being a thing you're constantly forcing yourself to</p>
<p>do on a daily basis</p>
<br>
<p>And this kinda makes me and a lot of people to be iffy about everyone they meet now, because you</p>
<p>don't know the type of person they really are, or the type of views they hold, if they're even</p>
<p>your friends, or if they're just around you to gain something, to leech from you.</p>
<br>
<p>Of course, back in the day, things were still pretty anonymous all things considered</p>
<p>but the most boring person you'd meet back in the day, would still make more of an impact on you</p>
<p>than the most popular face on the internet right now.</p>
<br>
<p>Another contributing factor is also the fact that social media has developed this bad habit of</p>
<p>showing how "happy and perfect your life is"</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>You go on things like Facebook, Twitter and specially Instagram, and you'll always find people</p>
<p>posting pictures of themselves in fancy places, parties and etc... and all of them with shitty</p>
<p>messages about always "always being positive and that struggles will make you stronger", and how</p>
<p>"they had to work their asses for everything they had"
<p>when everything that's coming out of their mouth is bullshit.</p>
<br>
<p>Most of these people NEVER worked for anything or for anyone, they were born in wealth, and most</p>
<p>of them never had any real, meaningful experiences, yet they're constantly trying to convince</p>
<p>everyone and themselves that they're bigger than they actually are, by showing the amount of</p>
<p>superficial and meaningless things they have in life</p>
<br>
<p>People who are so desperate for attention and approval of everyone are not happy<p>
<p>Neither with their lifes or themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>And this obsession of showing the world how "perfect and happy" you are is a mentality that has</p>
<p>caused nothing but harm everyone, both online and offline.</p>
<br>
<p>People now feel like you NEED to constantly let everyone know you're happy, that your life is</p>
<p>perfect, that showing any emotions besides "I'm made in life and I'm never sad" is a bad thing</p>
<br>
<p>One thing is taking a picture because you want to record a moment you genuinely enjoyed</p>
<p>the other is feeling the necessity to share it everywhere in a attempt to shove on everyone</p>
<p>else's face how much of a good time you had/you're having.</p>
<br>
<p>It's not only superficial</p>
<p>It's very sad.</p>
<br>
<p>What once was a fun thing to do, like record a video of yourself and your friends just bein silly</p>
<p>and posting it online because you thought it was fun, turned into an obsession into trying to profit</p>
<p>and get as much as attention as you possibly can at every single situation</p>
<p>And that's essentially what influencers boil down to</p>
<p>Desperate for success and attention, when in reality they're some of the saddest people out in the</p>
<p>world, because not only they're lying to themselves, they're lying to everyone too, and unfortunately</p>
<p>they do influence a lot of people's life, but not in a good way.</p>

<br>
<p>Unfortunately, everything good must come to an end</p>
<p>And sadly, that era of bliss and curiosity from the internet is now gone, and it's not coming back.</p>
<br>
<p>The focus has changed</p>
<p>The internet changed</p>
<p>The fun was changed</p>
<p>People changed.</p>
<br>
<p>But I'm still glad I had the chance to be a part of that golden era, no matter how silly it might have</p>
<p>been, I truly had fun, I've made many friends, learned lots of things, hell, the fact I even know how to</p>
<p>operate computers and even know how to speak english is due to me being a part of that curiosity and</p>
<p>fascination for the new people had back in the day, and I'm glad for that, despite all of my flaws as</p>
<p>a person, I think I'd be way worse if it wasn't for the internet, the people I've met there, and the</p>
<p>things I've learned here, in general, I probably would be even more boring than I am</p>
<p>Or I wouldn't even be in here anymore, all things considered.</p>
<br>
<p>It's gone and it's not coming back, but looking back at things can be a pretty bittersweet experience</p>
<p>and although things are not showing signs of improving, all we can do now is to make the best out of</p>
<p>a shitty situation.</p>
<br>
<p>I made this site as sort of a tribute to that, a time where creativity and personality would run</p>
<p>wild, and we were all just having fun, without a care in the world if we'd get witchhunted for it or not</p>
<br>
<p>I have more plans for this site, but I also wanted to make my first post meaningful and personal, and I</p>
<p>hope you enjoyed reading this, and either learned or absorbed anything out of this</p>
<br>
<p>Hell, even if you just laughed about all of this and thought it was stupid, that's good too</p>
<br>
<p>Either way, I hope you're all doing good.</p>
<br>
<p>I'll see you around.</p>

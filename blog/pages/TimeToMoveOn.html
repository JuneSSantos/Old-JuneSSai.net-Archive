<h1>Time To Move On</h1>
<p>Posted on August 11, 2022, 12:31</p>

<br>
<p>No, I'm not giving up on the site, it's actually the complete opposite, what I'm about</p>
<p>to do is going to give me the opportunity to work and do the things I want to do without</p>
<p>having to worry about everything falling apart the moment I'm actually enjoying my life</p>
<br>
<p>I'm making a change towards a better life</p>
<br>
<p>I'm absolutely tired of putting up with the shit of everyone around here, so I won't.</p>
<br>
<p>I'll move away from this house, and most likely will never talk to anyone in here again</p>
<p>because giving people so many chances when they clearly don't deserve it has fucked me</p>
<p>astronomically through my whole life and it continues to fuck me</p>
<br>
<p>You give people the chance to make up for the shit they've done wrong</p>
<p>You forgive them for things that should never be forgiven</p>
<p>But the only change is them shifting the blame towards you, because taking responsibility</p>
<p>and not being a terrible human being is too hard to be fucking accomplished</p>
<br>
<p>My frustration with the people around here and my living conditions got me thinking a lot</p>
<p>these past few days</p>
<br>
<p>Yesterday, my room was completely flooded due to the rain, like usual. and that's already</p>
<p>pretty fucking bad on it's own, but the fact I couldn't stop hearing the loud conversations</p>
<p>of strangers and my dad, since for some fucking reason, when most of the problematic people</p>
<p>have moved out of this house, he decides he should fill it with strange people, people that</p>
<p>I hate and they hate me, and this hate has been made very clear multiple times, but he keeps</p>
<p>insisting on trying to make me like them, and it's not going to happen</p>
<br>
<p>So last night was pratically just me, laying down on my sofa (I don't have a bed either)</p>
<p>staring at the ceiling and occasionally looking around the room, my phone was uncharged</p>
<p>my computer couldn't be turned on because of the rain, meaning that working on the website</p>
<p>was impossible, and I couldn't risk destroying the few equipment I still have, and overall</p>
<p>I was just feeling absolutely miserable, my mind was a blank.</p>
<br>
<p>But then, while looking around my bedroom, I ended up remembering about the painting I</p>
<p>hanged behind my desktop, a painting of a rocketship me and my mom painted together when</p>
<p>I was younger, and I couldn't stop looking at it, remembering everything my mom went through</p>
<p>in her life, many things that in a way, are the exact things I went and I'm still going through</p>
<br>
<p>Having her life essentially destroyed by a terrible partner</p>
<p>Living around terrible people and sticking around for no good reason</p>
<p>Destroying herself and giving up great opportunities on her own life when trying to help people</p>
<p>that won't ever do the same for her, surrounded by ungratefulness</p>
<br>
<p>She died trying to stand up for a shitty ground, a soil that had nothing to offer, but at the end</p>
<p>of the day, she was right about almost everything she predicted, specially when it came to "my</p>
<p>father being a piece of shit, and turning his back on me when I needed him the most"</p>
<br>
<p>Nowadays, she's my biggest inspiration in life, and at every chance I have, I try to follow her</p>
<p>steps and everything she could teach me, but I also need to learn when not to, and that learning</p>
<p>starts now.</p>
<br>
<p>I'm not going to beat myself over things I haven't done wrong anymore</p>
<p>I'm not going to give up doing the things I like because of awful people anymore</p>
<p>I'm going to finally take the shot, and hopefully change my life for the better</p>
<br>
<p>I'm still in the proccess of packing things up, throwing away what I don't need, and trying to</p>
<p>sort everything else out, and although I was initially resitant over asking anyone for favors</p>
<p>one of my cousins was kind enough to let me live with them for a while, at least until I sort</p>
<p>my shit out, so I'm going to swallow my pride and ego for a moment, and accept the help</p>
<br>
<p>I've certified myself that everything's going to be fine in here when it comes to my animals</p>
<p>since my current house has a lot of free space for them, I won't have to worry about my chickens</p>
<p>starving or anything, and I'll probably just visit from time to time to see how they're all doing</p>
<p>but I'm sure everything's going to be just fine, I've raised them well, and if any sort of opportunity</p>
<p>appears, I'm taking them with me</p>
<br>
<p>And once everything's sorted out, the website will probably be able to be updated with more frequency</p>
<p>due to me having a better workspace, more time, and a clearer head, so keep an eye for that, because</p>
<p>I have a lot of things in the backburner, just waiting to come out and surprise you all</p>
<br>
<p>As of right now, all I can say is; I'm happy.</p>
<br>
<p>If I couldn't keep myself down, nothing nor nobody will</p>
<p>I'll see you around.</p>

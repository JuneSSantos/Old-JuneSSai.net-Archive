<h1>Embracing Thyself</h1>
<p>Posted on April 11, 2022</p>
<p>Last updated on April 11, 2022</p>
<br>
<p>Oh, hello there!</p>
<p>Another fucking blog post? That's absolutely fucking right.</p>
<p>This one isn't going to be as long as previous posts since I want to save myself for the</p>
<p>next thing I've been writting quietly in the background, and don't worry, I promise you</p>
<p>the next post is going to be something actually fun and interesting</p>
<p>I just felt like writting this was necessary, and don't worry, the beginning of this post</p>
<p>is going to be a little bit negative, but I assure you, the more you reach towards</p>
<p>the end, the better it gets, so I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writting it.</p>
<br>
<p>Well, a few weeks ago(?), I was feeling incredibly depressive, to the point it was one of the</p>
<p>few times I've managed to cry after a good while, and during this whole thing, only one thing</p>
<p>was crossing my mind, one thought that refused to let me rest</p>
<br>
<p>"How better my life would be if I wasn't me"</p>
<br>
<p>And it's something that have bugged me through my whole life in all fairness, although it wasn't</p>
<p>as bad like it is nowadays ever since 2017/2018</p>
<p>And every time I think about it, it never fails to make me sad, because in a few ways, it's true</p>
<p>being the person I am brought me a lot of problems, most of them involving the perception of others</p>
<p>on how they see me and who they think I am, most of them pointing at me and laughing at me, thinking</p>
<p>I'm completely lost, I'm crazy, and never because maybe I'm just enjoying myself</p>
<p>and in a lot of ways even if I try to dismiss it, it hurts.</p>
<p>Trying to be anything besides what most people sees as "normal" will get all of the eyes in</p>
<p>the world on you watching every step you do to make fun of you the moment you do anything</p>
<p>without any regards if you if you will feel bad about it or not</p>
<br>
<p>Because of that, every time back in the day when I still used to go to school, people would</p>
<p>pick on me for being a goofy lil' guy, and at one point, people started to treat me like a</p>
<p>fucking animal, instantly dismissing everything I had to say or think, even if I was trying my best</p>
<p>to be completely serious, even when I never dismissed anyone no matter how fucking awful they acted</p>
<p>towards me before, and it was bad, really bad.</p>
<br>
<p>I'd see people having groups of friends were they were treating each other so nicely</p>
<p>Where they'd have fun with each other instead of making someone their whole punchbag</p>
<p>where someone would get serious and they wouldn't laugh at the other guy like everything that came out</p>
<p>of his mouth was a joke, and that made me feel incredibly miserable, and despite my best efforts to</p>
<p>change not only I couldn't do it, but I didn't want to</p>
<br>
<p>I didn't like being the serious guy, I didn't want to be completely normal, I enjoyed being silly</p>
<p>But I also wanted to be treated with the same respect as everyone got, and this fucking sucked</p>
<p>because at one point I felt really bad even trying to talk or be around anyone, since I felt the only</p>
<p>reason people were hanging around me was to poke fun of me, and never once they took the time to</p>
<p>realise that maybe I just like to be fun and get others to have fun, but I'm not an idiot</p>
<p>and I definitely don't like being treated as one</p>
<br>
<p>And this was specially true around 2018 when I had my breakup, and I still vividly remember</p>
<p>what happened around that time, something that played in a big part on me simply giving up</p>
<p>on trying to keep that relationship from falling apart completely beyond no repair, and one of the</p>
<p>main factors that played me into changing my name to "June" to begin with.</p>
<br>
<p>I love being a goofy guy in videogames, and I times I like being absolutely annoying and even</p>
<p>like a bit of an asshole in these games, and although most people justifiably get to hate me because</p>
<p>of that, some people really like that, and I end up making lots of friends and start a lot of</p>
<p>cool things like in-game parties or even just get people to join me in my stupidity, and it's</p>
<p>just the way I have fun</p>
<p>But she didn't like it, she hated it.</p>
<p>There was a point where we'd hop in online games, and I was just there trying to enjoy my time</p>
<p>with her, with me just being myself, and almost every time she'd say she's embarassed of me</p>
<p>that I should try to change, that it was hard to have fun with me, and that I should stop doing</p>
<p>my own thing</p>
<br>
<p>So I did.</p>
<br>
<p>I tried with everything I had in me, to not be me, and it wasn't fun</p>
<p>I felt like limited, I mentally visualized that it was wrong to be me, and I felt no one liked me</p>
<p>not even the girl I held so dearly to my heart, and it was breaking me, I was losing one of the</p>
<p>few things that made me feel like I had something "special" in me, and at one point, I even</p>
<p>stopped hanging with lots of my friends because I was either fucking depressive at all times</p>
<p>or I turned into an absolute bore, and I honestly don't blame anyone for doing it, I brought</p>
<p>that upon myself, and now I was absolutely unhappy both with everyone, and now myself.</p>
<p>Eventually, I threw the towel, she wanted to go, and I was tired of it all</p>
<p>I didn't want to, but unfortunately, I had to</p>
<p>But even after that, the damage was done, and I wasn't feeling like the same person anymore</p>
<br>
<p>I was a shell of my former self.</p>
<br>
<p>Things would get worse as time went on, but at some point, progress was being made</p>
<p>and at one point, I started to go back, back to days where I'd just do and say things because</p>
<p>I either found them funny or simply because I felt like it, I slowly started doing it with</p>
<p>online games with strangers, and eventually, I'd start doing it with friends too, either in</p>
<p>groups or voice calls, I was just enjoying myself and people would join me and to the same</p>
<p>and slowly but surely, I started regaining passion for things I liked to do back in the day</p>
<p>and once it hit me, the path I was heading into before couldn't be more depressing</p>
<br>
<p>I was essentially killing everything that I liked being, everything I was and stood for</p>
<p>for people that never really liked me, I was trying to be someone else, when I simply</p>
<p>couldn't and didn't want to</p>
<p>Even though I had some rough times because of my overall explosive personality, I was overall</p>
<p>pretty happy or at least satisfied with myself all things considered</p>
<p>I liked the way I was, my friends enjoyed being with me due to how I'd always get some crazy</p>
<p>ideas or say something incredibly weird or silly that was pretty much guaranteed to get a</p>
<p>laugh or two out of the situation, the people around me would instantly recognize me, because</p>
<p>you simply couldn't find anyone else like me, of course, you'd be able to find someone similar</p>
<p>to me, but only I could do and say things the way I did, and no matter how insignifcant that might</p>
<p>sound, it still means something, because if I were to be someone else, I'd lose everything</p>
<p>that made me unique or slightly fun to begin with</p>
<p>No matter how annoying I was, or how dumb I might sound, I was my own person</p>
<p>maybe not meant for greater things or even high successes, but just like everyone else, I was</p>
<p>in a way, irreplacable, because even if there was people that would do the same things as I did</p>
<p>if not better, only I could do it in a way that speaks "me"</p>
<br>
<p>And that, was liberating.</p>
<br>
<p>I felt a little bit more complete, like things were starting to make sense once again</p>
<p>and for once, I wasn't feeling as aimless I was feeling for a good while, and slowly but surely</p>
<p>I started to regain things again, I met a lot of cool people, and I also lost some</p>
<p>but that's just how people work some people will like you, some people will love you</p>
<p>some will dislike, and at times even hate you at times just because they don't like your</p>
<p>personality or the things that you like or find funny, and that's good people should genuinely</p>
<p>like or dislike you, and you shouldn't try to please everyone, because at one point</p>
<p>you end up pleasing no one, nor yourself</p>
<p>You should just do your own thing, and surely, people wil either come or move away from your life</p>
<p>and that's how it should be, people shouldn't force themselves to like or hate you</p>
<p>The reason why the world is so interesting and there's so many different types of groups out there</p>
<p>is not because someone is giving up their individuality to fit in somewhere</p>
<p>but because we all have something to add to the world or the people around us, no matter how</p>
<p>insignificant things might be in in the grand scheme of things, your ideas, the things you do</p>
<p>the things you say, the values you hold and the people you choose to hang around with make a huge</p>
<p>difference in the long run, even if you never reached any big heights yourself, the fact you</p>
<p>stumbled into someone's life at some point, most likely will change them in a way or another</p>
<p>small changes that might end up allowing them to be someone bigger in the future, and indirectly</p>
<p>even if you never know it, you contributed towards something big, because you and the person you</p>
<p>were inspired someone else, and in turn, the world, and that's why I say...</p>
<br>
<p>BE YOURSELF, NO MATTER HOW FUCKING EMBARASSING OR ANNOYING YOU MIGHT BE.</p>
<br>
<p>There's no problem in evolving, or even changing, but do it in a way that it doesn't kill</p>
<p>whatever makes you who you are, even if people wish for you to do so</p>
<p>Great people and great ideas only exist because someone went out of their way to do the things</p>
<p>they wanted to do, because someone took the initiative to follow whatever they wanted to achieve</p>
<p>at that time, because they either had a dream or a passion for it, instead of just regurgitating</p>
<p>the same ideas out to the public again</p>
<br>
<p>If you want to be absolutely goofy and quirky, do it. If you want to be an edgy nightmare, do it.</p>
<p>Do you have a passion for stupid things like Sonic? Anime? Quake? or whatever else?</p>
<p>Let that passion be known, and don't let anyone take it away from you.</p>
<p>even if others are not interested, at some point someone will, and out of that, maybe something</p>
<p>beautiful and genuine will be born out of it, it's not worth to destroy yourself trying to make</p>
<p>everyone like you or because you're so desperate to fit in somewhere, it's better to have</p>
<p>a genuine passion, no matter how cringy it might be in the eyes of the world, than just do things</p>
<p>because you're desperate for the attention or the clout, to be a forgettable success.</p>
<br>
<p>Embrace the cringe, and embrace thyself</p>
<p>You might be a nuisance in the eyes of someone else</p>
<p>But you're also someone special in the eyes of another</p>
<p>Even if people don't show it directly to you</p>
<p>No need to be everyone's hero</p>
<p>Just be a good friend, and somewhere, out there, someone will thank you for that.</p>
<br>
<p>It feels good to know people genuinely like you despite all of your flaws</p>
<p>and that's how it should be.</p>
<p>be genuine with everyone and yourself, and ask the same for everyone in your life</p>
<br>
<p>I know I always say that I wish I could be someone different, but I always regret saying that later</p>
<br>
<p>I'm happy being me.</p>
<p>I'm happy being Victor.</p>
<p>I'm happy being June.</p>
<p>I am all of me (just like that one music from Shadow The Hedgehog)
<p>and I don't want to change, I want to improve, and I'm glad that, despite everything, I'm still me.</p>
<br>
<p>I have some plans for this site, and in general for my future, and I hope to kick some ass soon</p>
<p>It might take a while, but I'll get there</p>
<p>Afterall, "Victor"y is in my name, and if I refuse to keep myself down, then up is the only way to go.</p>
<br>
<p>I hope you got anything from reading this, and I hope you're having a nice day, I am.</p>
<br>
<p>Also, I just gave up and ended up creating another discord account</p>
<p>send me an email if you want the new handle</p>
<br>
<p>But that's about it</p>
<p>I'll see you all around.</p>

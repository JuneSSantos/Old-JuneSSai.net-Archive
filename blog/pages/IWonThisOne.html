<p>Kept you waiting, huh?</p>
<br>
<p>This one is quite good and quite bad too, but I'll try to keep it sweet and short</p>
<p>And some details will be left out to maintain a little bit of privacy to myself</p>
<p>Oversharing on the internet is bad, yknow?</p>
<br>
<p>In August 16, I've made a post talking about how I moved out of my old house after enduring</p>
<p>about five to six years of constant fights, arguings and many other things amongst those lines</p>
<p>I went to live with one of my cousins on their apartment, that is until they got the notice that</p>
<p>they got fired, about one week I got in there, the timing was absolutely mental</p>
<br>
<p>To make matters worse; I've blocked my dad on everywhere and refused to respond to him since he</p>
<p>was the main reason why the arguments would even happen to begin with, mostly due to him being</p>
<p>willingly ignorant over his wife being a terrible person, not only to live with, but in general</p>
<p>to the point all of the other people (which were living in here through their whole lifes) moved</p>
<p>out of their own house because they simply couldn't stand him and her anymore, and that was also</p>
<p>my plan, but something pulled me back, like always</p>
<br>
<p>But this time, I was fucking done</p>
<p>Done of the bullshit, done of the lies, and specially done of what's essentially a stranger trying</p>
<p>to rule me and everything at my own house, and pretty much pushing everyone around me away</p>
<br>
<p>So things got pretty fucking ugly, I'll tell you what</p>
<p>But I don't regret it, not even a bit</p>
<br>
<p>Nobody died, don't worry about it</p>
<p>Things are just going somewhere now, finally</p>
<p>It was rough to get to this point, but we're finally here</p>
<br>
<p>The person who was causing all the trouble is finally moving somewhere else (as they should)</p>
<p>and my dad is going with them, but at least we got to talk a lot in these past few days</p>
<p>talk about things I should have told him years ago but never did, and things he needed</p>
<p>and wanted to tell me but he never did aswell</p>
<br>
<p>But most importantly; it's over</p>
<p>We're all on our own sides now, I'm on my own house, and they're in theirs</p>
<p>And I believe I stood for my ground, as I rightly should</p>
<br>
<p>I'm still here, standing</p>
<p>I'm about to get a full time job</p>
<p>I didn't allow some stranger to walk over me on my own house</p>
<p>I've proved my fucking point, and I think it's fair for me to say this</p>
<p>I won this one.</p>
<br>
<p>The prize might be an empire of shit, but it's still my empire of shit.</p>
<p>Probably not worth it, but whatever.</p>
<br>
<p>Sorry for the lack of updates, but I promise you all</p>
<p>I'll be back, and I'll be back for more</p>
<p>See you when the night goes down.</p>

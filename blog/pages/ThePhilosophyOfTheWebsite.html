<br>
<p>Holy shit... how far we've come, haven't we?</p>
<p>From having barely to no understanding of making a website and barely any content to back it up</p>
<p>To having a fully fledged, polished website with even it's own domain</p>
<br>
<p>At times I tend to forget the time flies when you're not looking.</p>
<br>
<p>It's been about 4 months since this website went up</p>
<p>A lot happened since then, a lot of good, and a lot of bad, and a lot of lessons have been learned</p>
<p>both when it comes to making this site and life in general, and instead of making a rant on how</p>
<p>I hate people and myself in here again, I'll talk about something more fun and that I'm actually</p>
<p>very interested in talking about, so let's sit down and take a look on how so much chan change</p>
<p>in so little time.</p>
<br>
<a href="../../blog/pages/images/Early2000sInternet/MysticalForestZone.png" target="_blank">

<br>
<p>I've always been interested on making my own website ever since I was little, I'd look around websites</p>
<p>like the Mystical Forest Zone and I'd be amazed on how those websites looked back in the day, and even</p>
<p>after so many years, they still cross through my head from time to time because of the nostalgia I have</p>
<p>for everything made around that era, because everything had this slick artstyle, it felt incredibly</p>
<p>modern and digital, and everything, from buttons, to site layout, it almost felt like a door into</p>
<p>the future, and things looked great</p>
<br>
<p>Until it didn't when Web 2.0 came around and everything started to fall apart</p>
<br>
<p>If you want to know more about my distaste for Web 2.0 and most of the things that sprouted along</p>
<p>with it, <span><a href= ../../blog/pages/Early2000sInternet.html>my other blog post</a></span> I made about it explains everything, but all</p>
<p>you need to know now, is that what was supposed to be a fun new era for the internet, turned into</p>
<p>everyone trying to make things purely based on profit and attention, instead of making it just for</p>
<p>the fun of it or because they had a passion for it, everything had to be professional or have some</p>
<p>sort of profitability behind it, and this absolutely killed a lot of the more amateur content that</p>
<p>I and others used to create and consume, and in my opinion, the more amateur content had a lot of</p>
<p>soul behind it, and the fact it was mostly gone since you didn't had the chance to compete with</p>
<p>the bigger media unless you somehow managed to make yourself look "professional" means that a lot</p>
<p>lost their incentive to create content, and fun sites, like the ones where you'd hop in to read</p>
<p>some guy talk about DooM and download WADs and sprites were suddenly gone, and what we had in the</p>
<p>place of those were dull, boring, souless sites that strived to be as awful and lazy as they</p>
<p>possibly get away with, and I always hated this, one of the biggest offenders being YouTube</p>
<p>to the point they even removed the whole thing in which you could customize the HTML and CSS</p>
<p>of your channel, ROBLOX is up there too, if not worse, but that's a whole other can of worms</p>
<p>I'm sincerely not ready to talk about yet.</p>
<br>
<p>Still, this era of the web has been incredibly miserable, while the first era was incredibly</p>
<p>optimistic, this era is incredibly pessimistic and nihilist by comparision, and this might</p>
<p>might sound incredibly ironic coming from me, but I hate it.</p>
<br>
<p>I know I've hammered this point down like, five times already, but I can't put enough</p>
<p>emphasis on people don't make content for fun anymore, it's either for profit or because</p>
<p>they want to complain about some stupid fucking drama over a guy that said the N word</p>
<br>
<p>I liked when people complaining about stuff was over superficial shit like how the newest</p>
<p>Sonic game sucks, or how SuperMarioLogan is not funny on some random DooM forum, but this</p>
<p>kind of stuff is long gone, and I always wanted to bring it back, but changing the world</p>
<p>all by yourself, no matter how small that world might be, is very fucking hard</p>
<br>
<p>But I could still make some sort of change, even if there's no one else there to see it</p>
<p>Luckily, I've met a lot of great friends that absolutely changed things for me</p>
<p>and one of them helped me spark my interest on those things again, enough for me to</p>
<p>actually bother to learn it for good this time</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>Octo's old website was extremely simple all things considered, but I still loved that</p>
<p>website just because of it's design and intent</p>
<br>
<p>It was just a website Octo made probably in a few days with a website template he grabbed</p>
<p>somewhere around the internet, but it instantly reminded of when I'd hop into some older</p>
<p>websites to download DooM mods or just check the crazy shit people would post on a daily</p>
<p>basis on some crazy website I found linked on a YouTube description, and Octo's site</p>
<p>became one of the sites I'd come to visit on a daily basis besides Newgrounds and YouTube</p>
<p>just because of how much I enjoyed the novelty of it, but the design wasn't the only thing</p>
<p>that kept me coming back...</p>
<br>
<img src="../../blog/pages/images/ThePhilosophyOfTheWebsite/octoeasteregg.png">
<br>
<p>It was the amount of weird things Octo did with his little website</p>
<p>He would make dumb new features and sections like the infamous gay list, and he'd even</p>
<p>leave little secrets and eastereggs hidden through his website and the sourcecode for</p>
<p>me to find it, and seeing Octo updating his website with new content always excited me</p>
<p>I never knew what was going to happen or what I was going to find next, and although</p>
<p>most of it was just a silly inside-joke within the code, I still really liked it</p>
<br>
<p>And that got me thinking...</p>
<p>"Man, now I really want to make my own website, how hard could it be?"</p>
<p>And the thought stuck in my head for a while, and when I realised that pretty much</p>
<p>everyone else around me was learning HTML and CSS, or just coding in general, I didn't</p>
<p>want to stay behind, and that gave me enough incentive for me to finally learn how to</p>
<p>use HTML and CSS to build my own website from the ground up, since I didn't want to use</p>
<p>things like Wix to make my website, since I always felt they'd never allow me to put the</p>
<p>personality I wanted into my website, so I asked around for a few sites that could help</p>
<p>me learning it, and I start messing around with things, just calling a few friends for</p>
<p>help here and there whenever the answer wasn't exactly obvious</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>And that for the night and the next day I worked on the site nonstop, with the help of</p>
<p>a few sites, a few friends, a lot of experimentation, I've essentially learned how to</p>
<p>use HTML and CSS overnight (which I'm very proud of despite how basic it is btw), and</p>
<p>the site was up and running, at the time, I didn't know what I wanted for it and for</p>
<p>it's future, but I knew one thing for sure; I wanted it, and everything in the site</p>
<p>to have a personal touch, I wanted everyone that stumbled upon this website to be</p>
<p>like "Oh, that's June!" even if they were just scrolling by, and I wanted things</p>
<p>to feel meaningful, I wanted people to get into this website and think about it years</p>
<p>later in the future and go; "Oh yeah, that website was pretty cool!" just like me</p>
<br>
<p>I wanted it to be special, both for me and to whoever stumbled upon it</p>
<p>Everything I would do with or for this website would have to be something I'm actually</p>
<p>interested or passionate about, no half-assing, no laziness, I wanted to make so</p>
<p>things would feel interesting and personal, even if no one else gave a shit about it</p>
<p>I would, and that's the rule I live by; I do the things in here mainly for myself</p>
<p>entertaining someone else is just a satisfying conclusion to an already rewarding "job"</p>
<br>
<p>There has been countless times in which I've scrapped essentially finished pages, because</p>
<p>I simply didn't feel the passion through them, they might be good for a read, but if it</p>
<p>wasn't for me, I wouldn't want it here, I wanted something I'd be proud to look at even</p>
<p>after the fact, something I'd look back even after months and still be proud of it, because</p>
<p>I'd be able to tell that a lot of effort and love went into it, and I want everyone else to</p>
<p>feel the same, to see something in here, and hopefully, whatever they see in here, isn't</p>
<p>gone of their heads in the next day, it sticks around, and that you'd maybe leave this place</p>
<p>knowing more than you did before you got in, and in many ways, this is also the reason why it</p>
<p>takes so long for new posts and updates to come out, if they're not substantial, I don't see</p>
<p>why they should be in here, everything has to be meaningful, even if that meaning is subtle</p>
<br>
<p>And the design of the site is also inheritely linked with this philosophy aswell</p>
<p>In my head, at least someone out there has accessed this website for the first time and went</p>
<p>"Holy shit, this is mega awesome!" because it either reminded them of Web 1.0, when DooM sites</p>
<p>were the hot shit, or because they felt that whatever they're looking at, has personality and</p>
<p>soul behind it, and if by any means this is the case, then my job was well done</p>
<br>
<p>I've explained this countless times, but this site was born both for my love of old websites</p>
<p>from when I started to use the internet, and my disdain on how boring and souless everything has</p>
<p>become nowadays, I've built the site and the content in it with love, but I'm proving my point</p>
<p>that everyone else is opting to be lazy and uninspired out of spite, to prove that it didn't need</p>
<p>to be like that, we could still have cool looking things, we could still make things for fun</p>
<p>just making things based if you can profit out of it will always be something I despise</p>
<br>
<p>A lot of people I know have asked me</p>
<p>"If you're not profiting of your website, why do you even have one to begin with?"</p>
<p>and this will always sadden me, no matter how many times I might have heard it</p>
<p>I'm not saying that you shouldn't profit out of your work, if you can find a way to win something</p>
<p>through your passion, I'd say you should go for it, but making profit should never be the sole</p>
<p>reason for you to do things or to sacrifice artistic value</p>
<br>
<p>I despise the modern mentality of things being utterly meaningless unless you can find a way to</p>
<p>earn money through it, even if it ends up ruining the whole spirit of the thing, and that's one</p>
<p>of the main things I also knew from the very beginning that I wanted for my website and all things</p>
<p>done by me in general; if I can find a way to earn something through the things I do, that's fine</p>
<p>but the things I do are first and foremost made for fun and out of passion, and I'll NEVER sacrifice</p>
<p>the merit of the fun and the care of my works in order to make some cash money here and there</p>
<br>
<p>There's no shame in doing things just for fun, even if people don't think the same</p>
<br>
<p>In general, there's a lot of things that I like that a lot of people, including my own friends think</p>
<p>are "cringe", but I don't see shame in liking them all, but that's honestly ok, everyone is cringe in</p>
<p>some way or another, but even when being cringe, people will respect passion, and if you have fun with</p>
<p>something, if you're passionate about it, eventually, people will feel the passion aswell</p>
<br>
<p>In general, this is the website's philosophy; passion</p>
<br>
<p>Passion for the things I like</p>
<p>Passion for the things I dislike</p>
<p>Passion for when I first started browsing the internet</p>
<p>Passion for learning new things</p>
<p>Passion for the friends and people I've met along the way that impacted</p>
<p>and are still impacting my life</p>
<p>Passion for all the things that make me the person I am today</p>
<p>either that's a thing to be proud of or not.</p>
<br>
<p>I've built this site with love and care, and even with all the troubles it has gone through</p>
<p>Including me being a disaster of a person, it changed and evolved with me, and it still continues to</p>
<p>even when I threw the towel here and there</p>
<br>
<p>But I don't think feeling down is any reason to be ashamed</p>
<p>I don't think it's bad to recognize your limits and maybe even give up here and there, however</p>
<p>I do see shame in not trying again, and that's what I've been doing</p>
<br>
<p>I've thrown the towel countless times, and I've come to get it back every time</p>
<p>Always saying it's the last time, but I'm always lying, and I always come back to try again</p>
<p>And I think this site in many ways is the culmination of all of these attempts</p>
<p>From a barebones website, to what I'd consider something truly refined and special</p>
<p>I was expecting it to be abandoned in a few weeks, but it's still up and going, with more things</p>
<p>to come, and looking back at when it first started, really makes me proud, because my efforts</p>
<p>paid off, and now, I have something truly incredible at my hands</p>
<p>I'll probably get burned out of it again, and I'll give up again, but I'll come back again</p>
<p>I always do.</p>
<br>
<p>It's only been 4 months, but I'm legitimately happy about everything accomplished in such</p>
<p>short amount of time, and there's more to come</p>
<br>
<p>For the few amount of people that still bother to read these or keep up with the website:</p>
<h1>Thank you for being badass!</h1>
<br>
<p>And to Octo; I told you I wouldn't abandon the site after a while</p>
<p>I just wish you could do the same for your websites, faggot!</p>
<br>
<p>But once again, I must go, I need to rest after</p>
<p>a whole day of doing absolutely nothing</p>
<p>but don't you worry, I'll (probably...?) be back very soon (Don't count on it.)</p>
<p>Until we meet again!</p>

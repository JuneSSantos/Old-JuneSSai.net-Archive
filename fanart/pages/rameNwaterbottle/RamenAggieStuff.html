<h1>June's Comment</h1>
<p>DID YOU THINK IT WAS OVER?</p>
<p>YOU WERE WRONG, I'M BRINGING MORE FANART, BRACE YOURSELVES.</p>
<br>
<p>Recently, I've been drawing in Drawpile and Aggie.io with rameNwaterbottle quite a lot</p>
<p>and it's honestly quite fun, it kinda helped me to stretch my art muscles once again</p>
<p>and in general, it was just a fun thing to do and to help me release some stress too</p>
<br>
<p>She's really fucking good with expressions, and the way she draws Whiskey makes me</p>
<p>REALLY happy, and her expressions are legitimately some of the best I've seen</p>
<p>and it also helps a lot that she's VERY GOOD with dirty stuff aswell</p>
<br>
<p>My favorite part about all of these was the Mokkori x Big Whiskey stuff</p>
<p>Mokkori wearing a sunflower legitimately brings me a lot of joy, and seeing them sitting</p>
<p>together so happy, with Whiskey sharing a sunflower with her, is legitimately beautiful</p>
<br>
<p>If you're interested in seeing the full canvas, go check her page</p>
<p>Just do it in general, she makes some good stuff.</p>
<br>
<p>And that was about it</p>
<p>I'll be back</p>
<p>Have a nice night.</p>

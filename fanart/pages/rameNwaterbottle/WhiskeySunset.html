<h1>June's Comment</h1>
<p>Eyyyy, new person on the fanart section!</p>
<p>Holy shit, it's rameNwaterbottle!</p>
<br>
<p>She was accepting requests on her Newgrounds page, so I decided to request Big Whiskey</p>
<p>as of expected, and she ended up accepting it!</p>
<br>
<p>So after torturous one or two days, she finished the piece and uploaded it on Newgrounds</p>
<p>and holy shit, let me tell you, my expectations were already pretty high, I was unironically</p>
<p>pretty excited to see what she'd come up with, and when she finally uploaded it, my expectations</p>
<p>were not only surprassed, but blown away.</p>
<br>
<p>This is no exaggeration when I say; this is one of the coolest things anyone ever did for me.</p>
<br>
<p>I've been honestly thinking about sunsets a lot recently, reminding of the days when I'd get the</p>
<p>bus after school, both to go to my dad's house and return to my mom's home, and I'd remember I'd</p>
<p>look through the window in amazement to the sun setting down, and how the bright lights of the city</p>
<p>would make even some of the most mistreated places a beautiful neon paradise, while I'd either listen</p>
<p>to music on my phone, or play Mother 3 on it, even though it would suck at times to wait for the bus</p>
<p>the loud people, and a lot of waiting to get to my destiny, it was also kinda fun, and in a way, every</p>
<p>time I ride a bus, it always comforts me in a weird way, in fact, every time I hear some of the</p>
<p>songs from Mother 3, I always remind myself of these strangely comforting times riding buses</p>
<p>It's very weird, but public transporation has something uniquely strange to it... kinda.</p>
<br>
<p>This piece in a weird way is strangely comforting</p>
<br>
<p>I love the setting a lot, actually</p>
<p>The way Big Whiskey is just looking at the unknown horizon, looking a little bit worried about something</p>
<p>while the wind is just blowing through him and the leafs, his hair and his clothes flowing in the air</p>
<p>it's honestly magical how it has such a "wonderful" feeling to it, I specially like how she made him have</p>
<p>his shirt in display aswell, it's incredibly weird how in many ways. it's reminiscent of the old me</p>
<p>I've always been wearing jackets, and I always loved just looking at the scenery around me, and the places</p>
<p>where I used to go also used to be incredibly windy, so the wind would be constantly blowing on my eyes and</p>
<p>I'd always be holding a hand over my eyes to try and keep my vision clear, and in general, I just love the</p>
<p>posing and composition of this piece as a whole, it feels very "hopeful" in a weird way</p>
<br>
<p>Even if we're afraid, we're always looking ahead, towards the future.</p>
<br>
<p>This is one of my new favorite things, and I absolutely love everything about it</p>
<p>The colors, the pose, the scenario, the way everything is composed, the feeling it holds, it's magical</p>
<p>and I wouldn't want it any other way.</p>
<br>
<p>Give Ramen some love, go check the rest of her art, it's great.</p>
<br>
<p>Once again, that was it, for now.</p>
<p>Peace out, suckers. It's been real.</p>

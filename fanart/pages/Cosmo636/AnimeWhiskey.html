<h1>June's Comment</h1>
<p>Oh yeah, this one</p>
<p>This one's probably one of my favorite ones</p>
<p>Hell, I literally created the "Special" folder because of this single art</p>
<br>
<p>2021 wasn't exactly a good year either, but there was definitely highlights</p>
<p>One of those highlights was meeting Cosmo and one of her friends</p>
<p>I remember spending a good part of the ending of 2021 talking with them both, and it</p>
<p>was honestly such a nice change of pace to what felt like five years of absolute misery</p>
<p>and I don't want to dive too much into this kind of stuff right now, since I'm genuinely</p>
<p>feeling good about life right now, but it felt like I finally managed to drag myself</p>
<p>out of hell, and there was finally something waiting for me in the tomorrow</p>
<br>
<p>One day out of nowhere, while we were in the middle of a voice call, Cosmo made me this</p>
<p>picture, and I remember how happy I was, and I instantly saved it everywhere and set it</p>
<p>as my PFP for a good while on pretty much everywhere, and even up to this day, I still</p>
<p>really love this picture</p>
<br>
<p>Most of the time when people draw me or my character, they either give him a neutral</p>
<p>expression, or make him very angry and/or sad, rightfully so, since it's what I always</p>
<p>intended for him to be, me, but this was one of the first and few times someone actually</p>
<p>made him look so bright and happy, which is still kinda funny to me, it definitely has a</p>
<p>"hopeful" feeling to it, much like what I was feeling around that time, and this piece will</p>
<p>forever be one of my favorite ones, I love this.</p>
<br>
<p>She deserves it all, please, give her your support.</p>
<br>
<p>That's about it for now</p>
<p>I hope you're all are having a good day</p>
<p>I'll see you around.</p>

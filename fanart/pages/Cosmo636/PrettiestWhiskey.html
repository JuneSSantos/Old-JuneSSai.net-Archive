<h1>June's Comment</h1>
<p>Another one I really adore!</p>
<br>
<p>She made this one out of nowhere aswell, one day I was just hanging around Discord</p>
<p>and out of nowhere, she just posted it on one of the groups I was in, and honestly</p>
<p>I was stunned.</p>
<br>
<p>I really like the angle she gave my little character, I don't know why, but characters</p>
<p>looking up, mostly when they're looking at the horizon is legitimately one of the poses</p>
<p>I like the most, and the fact she made him look a bit tired is something I really dig aswell</p>
<p>In general, I adore Cosmo's art, so of course I would end up adoring this aswell.</p>
<br>
<p>Like I said in the last post, give her your support.</p>
<br>
<p>That's about it for now</p>
<p>I hope you're all are having a good day</p>
<p>I'll see you around.</p>

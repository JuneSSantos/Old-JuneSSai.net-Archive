<h1>June's Comment</h1>
<p>Yoooo, new artist on the fanart section!</p>
<p>This time it's my good friend, MachiToons!</p>
<br>
<p>This one is quite funny, because she never told me that she did this herself</p>
<p>I just decided to hop on her twitter profile one day and look at what she was posting</p>
<p>And after scrolling a little bit, I found it there, in all it's full glory.</p>
<br>
<p>And yeah, I know it's not exactly for me, since there's like, 50 fucking different</p>
<p>people on it, but it's the intention that counts, and honestly, I just really like</p>
<p>how this looks, so I'm glad to be allowed to display it on my site</p>
<br>
<p>There's so many faces, some of them I actually had the chance to meet and befriend them!</p>
<p>and I find a lot of these characters to be pretty cool, and the silly little faces they're</p>
<p>making put a big fucking smile in my stupid fucking face, so this is pretty great!</p>
<p>and Machi was always a good friend, so I'm happy to have her featured in here too!</p>
<br>
<p>Go check the rest of her works, she's been working pretty hard lately!</p>
<br>
<p>That's about it for now</p>
<p>Peace out, suckers. It's been real.</p>

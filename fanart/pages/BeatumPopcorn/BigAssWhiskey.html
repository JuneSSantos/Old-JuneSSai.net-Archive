<h1>June's Comment</h1>
<p>What's that? Another Beatum fanart?</p>
<p>Damn, we're really on a roll, aren't we lads?</p>
<br>
<p>And this one? My god, it's fucking amazing</p>
<p>Starting with the angle, I absolutely love how Big Whiskey is framed in the art, it's such</p>
<p>a good angle, it really helps set the melancholic tone that he went with this one</p>
<p>in general, I just love how in many ways, he nails my character better than I do, lmao</p>
<p>One of the main things that pleases me in this is the expression, I always like drawing</p>
<p>Big Whiskey with a defeated expression, since y'know, he's supposed to be me, and I mentioned</p>
<p>this in earlier posts, Beatum NAILS when it comes to faces and expressions, it's fan-fucking-tastic</p>
<p>Also, little trivia, this art is based on one of the sketches I showed him on discord, explaining why</p>
<p>Big Whiskey always wears arm bandages and how he keeps hurting his hands, Caira was in the sketch too</p>
<p>but she's not in this piece, unfortunately :(</p>
<br>
<p>This is also the background for the main fanart page, so yes, this one is absolutely incredible.</p>
<br>
<p>Real, go support his art, he's pretty fucking awesome!</p>
<br>
<p>That's about it for now</p>
<p>I hope you're all are having a good day</p>
<p>I'll see you around.</p>

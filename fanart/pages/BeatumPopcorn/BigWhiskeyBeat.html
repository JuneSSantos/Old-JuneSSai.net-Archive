<h1>June's Comment</h1>
<p>The fanart page is finally up, and what's the best way than to premier it with the person that</p>
<p>helped me a lot recently, both with coming back to art, and in general is just absolutely</p>
<p>the greatest and the coolest person ever, BeatumPopcorn.</p>
<br>
<p>I've been talking to this fella for a good while now, and he helped me get into a good mood again</p>
<p>He even was the reason why I got my tablet working again, and in general the reason why I've been<p>
<p>getting back into art again, and not only I've been spending a good amount of time with him, but</p>
<p>he also made me so truly amazing stuff recently, and I think it's only fitting if he's one of the</p>
<p>debut artists in the fanart page, and honestly, I love this piece to death, even if it's still not</p>
<p>finished yet. I really like the way he colors everything, the way he draws bodies, and I specially</p>
<p>love his expressions, he really captured the feeling of "a badass asshole" Big Whiskey has, and I'm</p>
<p>legitimately excited to see it finished!</p>
<br>
<p>Aaaaaaand it's finished</p>
<p>And it looks fucking incredible</p>
<p>I specially adore the reference to the fanart I've made for him with the bird and the fact this</p>
<p>drawing and the drawings I've made for him kinda have a continuation when you piece them together</p>
<p>The first part being my first fanart, the second part being this piece, and the third being the</p>
<p>fanart I've made stylized in the TBOI style, this little story is really adorable, and this art</p>
<p>is incredible, and I love it, and I will forever cherish it.</p>
<br>
<p>Seriously, go give his art a check, right now! give him your love and a follow!</p>
<br>
<p>That's about it for now</p>
<p>I hope you're all are having a good day</p>
<p>I'll see you around.</p>

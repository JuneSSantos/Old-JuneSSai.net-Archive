<h1>June's Comment</h1>
<p>It's been a while since I updated this section, but it shouldn't be a surprise that once again</p>
<p>it's BeatumPopcorn doing fanart of my character considering that 90% of the Fanart Section</p>
<p>is mostly his art, and as usual, he keeps blowing my mind on how good the stuff he makes looks.</p>
<br>
<p>He's been into a "Manga Mood" he told me, and he decided to draw Big Whiskey in a very manga style</p>
<p>and it looks absolutely fucking brilliant</p>
<br>
<p>Big Whiskey was always supposed to be a depressing/melancholic character since he's supposed to be</p>
<p>a more interesting version of me. He was made to have a very friendly and bright appearance that would</p>
<p>heavily contrast with his rather abrasive and depressive personality and overall mood, and somehow</p>
<p>I think Beatum does a better job at presenting this than I ever could</p>
<br>
<p>He mentioned himself that he likes drawing my character exactly due to the fact that Big Whiskey</p>
<p>is very melancholic, he likes how sad he is, and Beatum captures this feeling perfectly</p>
<br>
<p>I'm just staring at this, and I'm just amazed how much sentiment he put into this piece</p>
<p>I just look into his face, and the little smile and his beady eyes makes it feel like someone</p>
<p>trying to hide hurt under a fake smile, and I fucking love it</p>
<p>The way he managed to make the messy hair he has feel more natural while still retaining the shape</p>
<p>I usually draw Big Whiskey with, and the sketchy line work, this is all pretty briliant</p>
<br>
<p>This is legitimately one of my favorite pieces I've ever received, and since I'm already in a very</p>
<p>sad mood, it fits me perfectly.</p>
<br>
<p>I apologize if I couldn't say more, my head's spinning as of writting this, and I need some rest</p>
<p>But don't you worry, there is more to come</p>
<br>
<p>But other than that, that's it for now, I'll see you when I close my eyes.</p>

<h1>June's Comment</h1>
<p>IT IS I, WHISKEY!</p>
<br>
<p>This one is pretty simple, Beatum wasn't even planning on finishing it, but he did</p>
<p>So I felt like this definitely belonged in here, specially since I like it a lot</p>
<p>despite how simple and basic it is</p> 
<br>
<p>He drew him with Whiskey's new design (which I didn't make a ref sheet for yet) and</p>
<p>I really like how he draws Whiskey, either he's drawing him completely silly, or looking</p>
<p>absolutely defeated, and it's something I really appreciate in every single one of his</p>
<p>works too, he's very expressive with very little, and the way he drew Whiskey in this</p>
<p>and the colors he picked are sincerely great, it really helps me to adore the new design</p>
<p>even more than I already do.</p>
<br>
<p>Go check the rest of his art, as usual.</p>
<br>
<p>And that was about it</p>
<p>Once again, I take my leave</p>
<p>You have a good night now.</p>

<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Last Update: July 22, 2022, 09:42<span class="NewText">(New!)</span></p>
<br>
<p>I'm June S. Sai, if the name of the site didn't make this clear already</p>
<p>I also go by the name "RootPain" at times, but I mostly just stick to my regular name</p>
<p>I'm an artist, editor, web designer, and perfectly average at everything besides videogames</p>
<p>I also raise a lot of chickens, there's that too.</p>
<br>
<p>I mostly do things either for fun, for the sake of learning something new, or I do things</p>
<p>purely based on spite to prove my point or prove someone wrong, like this site, which</p>
<p>mostly originates from my hatred towards the modern internet always being eager of</p>
<p>stripping the personality out of everything and making everything feel souless</p>
<p>and also my overall dissapointment over the lack of personal websites in recent times</p>
<p>so my frustration with art and the fact a lot of my friends were learning HTML and CSS</p>
<p>gave me enough incentive for me to learn it myself and try and make the change I want</p>
<p>to see in the world myself, thus, this site was born, an attempt to recapture and recreate</p>
<p>everything I like and liked about the internet in this one little space, and I believe</p>
<p>I did a good job with it all things considered, specially since this is the first website</p>
<p>and anything HTML/CSS related I've ever made</p>
<br>
<p>I'm a big fan of good things, but I'm a super fan of things like Sonic, Quake, Serious Sam</p>
<p>Worms, most if not all GoldSrc and Source Engine games, Dragon Ball (and Dragon Ball Z)</p>
<p>Guilty Gear and the list goes on</p>
<br>
<p>I don't have musical preferences, as I just listen to things that sound good to me</p>
<p>and it also varies a lot depending on my mood</p>
<p>You'll mostly find "my taste in music" in the daily music recommendations</p>
<p>if you're really interested in knowing it</p>
<br>
<p>If you ever have a problem with me, don't be afraid to tell me, simple as that.</p>
<br>
<p>If you need a way to contact me, just send me an email at EpicSaiJune2001@gmail.com</p>
<br>
<p>Special thanks to Octo, Daemon and Stork for helping me with the HTML and CSS!</p>
<p>And another special thanks to BeatumPopcorn for the background aswell!</p>

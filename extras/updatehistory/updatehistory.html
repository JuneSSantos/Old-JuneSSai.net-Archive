<h1>Update History</h1>
<p>Last Update: September 2, 2022, 02:50<span class="NewText">(New!)</span></p>
<br>
<p>See how the site grew as the time went by, from a barely functional website</p>
<p>To an awesome website filled with things that make you laugh and cry!</p>
<br>
<h1>September 2, 2022</h1>
<p>The logo was changed into a slicker, more refined design</p>
<br>
<h1>September 1, 2022</h1>
<p>The dates for all of the Guestbook Messages were finally added</p>
<p>My own comment on the Guestbook was changed aswell</p>
<br>
<p>The Donate Section was moved out of the extras and was made into one of the</p>
<p>main sections of the site</p>
<br>
<h1>August 31, 2022</h1>
<p>The style and visuals for the blog posts were altered</p>
<br>
<p>A new blog post "I Won This One" was added</p>
<br>
<p>The Guestbook Section also had a lot of it's code rewritten in order to look</p>
<p>and function better</p>
<br>
<p>The Donate Section was added to the Extras Section</p>
<br>
<p>A new font called "Andes", which was the font used in Sonic 3 for the</p>
<p>zone transition screens was added to be download in the Fonts Section</p>
<br>
<h1>August 26, 2022</h1>
<p>The Partners Section had it's visuals and navigation updated</p>
<br>
<p>A lot of the banners (mostly of the newer sections) have been resized in</p>
<p>order to fit the website better</p>
<br>
<h1>August 25, 2022</h1>
<p>Petscop Fonts, a pack with six fonts included within it was added to be</p>
<p>downloaded at the Fonts Section</p>
<br>
<p>The Games & Fangames section for the download section was also finally</p>
<p>implemented, and with that, a visual overhaul on the downloads section to make</p>
<p>things more presentable and easier to navigate</p>
<br>
<h1>August 24, 2022</h1>
<p>The Fonts Section for the Downloads Section finally received a visual overhaul</p>
<p>Implementing it was a problem however, since the code I was using wasn't giving me</p>
<p>the results I was looking for, so I resorted into asking it at stackoverflow.com</p>
<p>which ended up giving me exactly what I was looking for, and thus, the Fonts Sec-</p>
<p>tion was finally presentable and good looking</p>
<br>
<h1>August 23, 2022</h1>
<p>The first section of the Downloads section was finally implemented, the "Fonts" section</p>
<p>The design is very rough at the moment, but I was mostly focused on getting it up and running</p>
<p>so I could then think about working on the design side later</p>
<br>
<p>A few older pages on the art section also had their metadata finally implemented, and the same</p>
<p>is planned for the rest of the pages aswell</p>
<br>
<h1>August 16, 2022</h1>
<p>A new blog post "New House, New June" was added to the Blog Section</p>
<br>
<h1>August 15, 2022</h1>
<p>The Update History section was finally finished, and with it, some of the history of the</p>
<p>site's development, alongside some commentary and a few trivias with it aswell.</p>
<br>
<h1>August 13, 2022</h1>
<p>The site finally had proper metadata implemented into it, although some of the older pages</p>
<p>still lack metadata as of me writting this</p>
<br>
<p>The extras section was also implemented into the site, even though it's unfinished.</p>
<br>
<h1>July 30, 2022</h1>
<p>The site finally got it's own domain, and while it's still being hosted through github pages</p>
<p>It could finally have the proper URL it was always meant to have, <a href="https://junessai.net/">JuneSSai.net</a>.</p>
<br>
<h1>March 26, 2022</h1>
<p>The site was born in a very primitive state, although it wouldn't take long for the site</p>
<p>to take shape, I implemented the first few pages and sections pretty much overnight</p>
<p>those being the Home, Blog, Art, Guestbook and About sections since they were the most</p>
<p>important parts of the site in my opinion. The site was (and still is) hosted through</p>
<p>github pages, and I didn't knew you could update things through folders, so I'd make</p>
<p>every change through github itself, means that every little update would require me</p>
<p>to wait until the site updated on my end to make another change, that was it for a good</p>
<p>few days until Octo pointed out to me I could do it all through my desktop and Vim</p>
<p>The first few months of the site were incredibly experimental, but they were also some</p>
<p>of the most fun I've had building it, and the first few iterations of the site helped</p>
<p>to shape what the site is today, so overall, the first few days of the website were pretty</p>
<p>great, even if things were extremely rough.</p>
